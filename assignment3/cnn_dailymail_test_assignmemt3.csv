7409,"The FA Cup, the oldest knockout football competition in the world, is set to be rebranded as the Emirates FA Cup in a new £30million sponsorship deal . In a move that will upset traditionalists, the FA are understood to have secured a three-year contract with Emirates Airlines. The deal, due to be rubber-stamped by the FA board on Thursday, is believed to be worth at least £10million a year — but comes at a cost for lovers of the 144-year-old competition. Arsenal won last season's FA Cup competition, which will be rebranded the Emirates FA Cup . Aston Villa will face the holders Arsenal in this season's final at Wembley Stadium . Renaming it the Emirates FA Cup is a lot closer to title sponsorship than the previous ‘in association with Budweiser’ agreement, which was worth £9m annually. But the FA, after a highly embarrassing season without any Cup backer that has put huge pressure on their commercial department, needed to offer more to attract a significant sponsor to the table. The hunt proved hugely difficult even after the FA revamped their sponsorship team to bring in expertise honed at Manchester United. And it needed a bit of luck to attract Emirates Airlines, who have a massive sports sponsorship portfolio across the world that includes Arsenal’s stadium and kit. Emirates have big money to spend after deciding last November not to renew their £30m-a-year FIFA sponsorship for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups with the corruption allegations surrounding those tournaments said to be a consideration. And Emirates are no longer involved, either, in the tender for a Champions League airline sponsor, allowing the FA to offer a major football sponsorship alternative. Dubai-based Emirates have their arch Abu Dhabi airline rivals Etihad as Manchester City’s kit and stadium sponsors. But City foresee no problems with an Emirates FA Cup. Villa beat Liverpool in their semi-final to deny Steven Gerrard (centre) the chance of a final trophy . The new FA deal with Emirates will also allow for a further six subsidiary sponsors for the competition, with Budweiser, Nike and William Hill already signed up. And the ambition is for the whole FA Cup sponsorship portfolio to be worth £20m by 2018. The Emirates deal, likely to be officially announced nearer to the FA Cup final on May 30, is also well-timed for the FA’s commercial department with the new chief executive Martin Glenn arriving at Wembley next month.","FA Cup is set to be named Emirates FA Cup as part of sponsorship deal .

5376,"(CNN)Slamming world powers' framework nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday demanded that any final deal include a ""clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel's right to exist."" Netanyahu has been perhaps the most vocal critic of nuclear talks with Iran, insisting again and again it can't be trusted. He took his case to the U.S. Congress last month, at a time before negotiators had hammered out any sort of agreement, over the objections of President Barack Obama. There's never been any dispute about his take, but the Prime Minister has sharpened his rhetoric in recent days, saying the deal increases the risk of a ""horrific war."" Iranian President: We will stick to our promises on nuclear deal . Netanyahu has lobbied hard for a deal that dismantles and disassembles Iran's nuclear infrastructure -- rather than limiting its usage or repurposing Iran's facilities -- but such stipulations were not part of the framework agreement. He has also called for the removal of sanctions to be tied to the reduction of what he characterizes as Iran's aggression in the region, not just its moves on its nuclear program . In the absence of both elements, Netanyahu is calling the emerging deal a historic mistake. After an emergency Cabinet meeting Friday afternoon hours before the Jewish holiday of Passover, Netanyahu said the agreement ""would pose a grave danger to the region and to the world and would threaten the very survival of the state of Israel."" "" ... I want to make clear to all: The survival of Israel is non-negotiable,"" Netanyahu said. ""Israel will not accept an agreement which allows a country that vows to annihilate us to develop nuclear weapons, period."" Obama called Netanyahu after Thursday's announcement of the framework agreement to reassure him that Israel's security will remain a prime concern in the ensuing negotiations and the final deal, which faces a June 30 deadline. ""There is no daylight when it comes to our support for Israel's security,"" Obama said, reaffirming the American commitment to Israel's security. But Netanyahu said he isn't convinced Israel is safe from Iran. ""Just two days ago, Iran said that 'the destruction of Israel is non-negotiable.' And in these fateful days Iran is accelerating the arming of its terror proxies to attack Israel."" The Israeli leader added that ""this deal would legitimize Iran's nuclear program, bolster Iran's economy and increase Iran's aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond.""","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slams nuclear framework deal with Iran .

9736,"A police officer feared for his life when he fired the final shots in a barrage of bullets that killed two unarmed suspects, a court has heard. Michael Brelo, 31, made his first appearance in court in Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. Brelo's attorney Patrick D'Angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that Brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' vehicle. But Brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in November 2012 had ample reason to believe that Russell and Williams were shooting at them, he said. Self defense? Michael Brelo's attorney opened the case insisting the 31-year-old (pictured today) had reason to believe he was being shot at when he jumped on the car and shot dead Timothy Russell and Melissa Williams . D'Angelo said he wasn't calling what Brelo and the other officers did that night heroic. 'They are simple, ordinary people who try to do the best they can and are put in very dangerous situations,' he said. Brelo, charged with voluntary manslaughter, is the only officer charged because prosecutors said he waited until after the initial salvo had ended to reload and discharge the last of the 49 rounds he fired that night. A judge will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Rick Bell revealed that experts have concluded that another officer fired three rounds during Brelo's 15-shot volley, something defense attorneys have argued in motions. Bell said a medical examiner has concluded that Brelo fired 'kill shots' into Russell and Williams and that they were still alive when Brelo fired from the top of a police cruiser and the trunk of the Malibu, striking Williams 11 times and Russell six times, when they were no longer a threat to anyone. Brelo fired out of a sense of rage and vengeance after he and his partner became one of the first cars to join what would be a 19-mile chase on city streets and freeways with speeds reaching 100 mph, Bell said. Cleveland officer Michael Brelo is facing charges after two unarmed suspects were killed in this Chevy Malibu . Malissa Williams (left) and Timothy Russell (right) were both unarmed when they were killed in November 2012 . The prosecutor criticized Brelo and others for violating departmental policies that required permission to chase a suspect vehicle. More than 100 Cleveland police officers in five dozen cars were involved in the chase at some point. 'His pursuit of 22 minutes described the final outcome,' Bell said of Brelo. 'He should have never been in that position to begin with.' D'Angelo argued that Officer Wilfredo Diaz, who fired the initial rounds after Russell drove the Malibu toward him, could have killed Russell and Williams. Those shots prompted other officers to begin firing because they believed Russell and Williams were shooting at them. 'These officers were scared to death,' D'Angelo said. 'They thought they were in a gun battle.' The car was strafed by police gunfire after a high-speed chase over streets and freeways in and around Cleveland. When Brelo was questioned by investigators two weeks after the shooting, he told them he didn't recall what happened. He said: 'It's possible because I was so terrified that I was going to get run over.' 'But I don't recall that, sir.' Rookie officer Brian Sabolik  who was assigned to the same district as Brelo, told investigators he stopped firing after 'someone' jumped on the hood of the Malibu. Photos released by the Office of the Ohio Attorney General show a Cleveland cruiser sitting next to the Chevy . Officer Sabolik said he later learned it was Brelo. Asked how he found out, Sabolik said: 'Because [Brelo] was talking about it.' While Brelo claimed not to remember jumping on the hood, prosecutors have evidence to show that he did. Investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation found footprints on the hood of the Malibu that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar. Brelo is currently suspended. A judge - not a jury - will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. Brelo's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful. The threat from the pair didn't end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon, according to his defense. Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times. The chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he'd lost sight of the vehicle. Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired. Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase. Brelo and his partner were two of the first officers to join the pursuit that ultimately included more than 60 police cars, 104 officers and reached at least 100mph. In this forensics picture, bullet trajectories from the deadly shooting are marked off on the Chevy Malibu . Investigators found footprints on the hood of the Malibu (left) that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car (right) that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar . After driving into a school parking lot more than 20 minutes after the chase began, Russell turned the car around and tried to flee again - sideswiping a cruiser before coming to a stop. Another officer, who said he feared for his life, opened fire, prompting others including Brelo to do the same. Brelo and his partner fired 15 rounds through their own windshield and told investigators they saw dark objects in Russell's and Williams' hands. Brelo said he left his cruiser because he said he was afraid the Malibu would hit him, even though he then crossed in front of the car to climb on top of another cruiser and open fire again. He told investigators: 'I had leapt trying to get out of the way of this car so it doesn't run me over and kill me.' Investigators eventually concluded that neither Russell nor Williams had a gun. An exhaustive search was conducted along the route of the pursuit, including the use of a dive team to look in bodies of water, but no gun was ever found. Regardless of the trial's outcome, the after-effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come. The incident helped spur a US Justice Department probe that concluded Cleveland police officers have shown a pattern and practice of using excessive force. The city and federal authorities are negotiating a consent decree to reform the police department that will cost the city millions of dollars to implement and enforce. Cleveland has already paid $3million to the families of Russell and Williams to settle a lawsuit.","Cleveland, Ohio, officer Michael Brelo is facing two counts of manslaughter .

4792,"A 19-year-old girl was forced to relearn basic functional skills such as walking, swallowing food and getting dressed after she fell out a fraternity house's window and suffered a traumatic brain injury. Summer Elbardissy was partying at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, last year when she reportedly tried to reach a makeshift roof deck. But instead of making it onto the deck, where students often gathered, she fell out of a third-story window, according to newly-released police reports and a lawsuit filed in the city's Superior Court. Moments later, another teenager heard what 'sounded like a thud hitting the ground'. Miss Elbardissy was discovered lying unconscious on the floor, with her face covered in blood. Scroll down for video . Recovering: Summer Elbardissy (pictured) had to relearn basic functional skills such as walking, swallowing food and getting dressed after she fell out a fraternity house's window and suffered a traumatic brain injury . Frat house: The 19-year-old was reportedly partying at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house (pictured) at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, last year when she tried to reach a makeshift roof desk . The intoxicated sophomore was rushed to St Francis Hospital with serious injuries, including a brain injury and swelling, a broken skull and pelvis, and lung bruising, the Hartford Courant reported. She was forced to undergo intubation and had to relearn how to walk, according to a GoFundMe page that was set up by  Miss Elbardissy's mother, Inas Morsi, after last September's accident. She also had to be taught by a therapist how to swallow food, brush her teeth, get dressed and wash herself, it is reported. Seven months on, she is apparently still recovering from the fall. On the fundraising page, which has raised more than $44,000 for the teenager, Ms Morsi has described her daughter as a 'fighter', adding: 'this is just another battle that she will overcome.' In November, she wrote: 'This is a special Thanksgiving for our family. We are thankful for so many things. We are especially thankful for all of the support you have shown us for Summer.' And Miss Elbardissy herself appears to be in good spirits - over the past few months, she has posted smiling photos and positive messages on her Facebook and Instagram pages on a regular basis. Injured: Instead of making it onto the deck, where students often gathered, Miss Elbardissy (pictured with a companion in a Facebook photo) fell out of a third-story window, according to newly-released police reports . Sophomore: Miss Elbardissy (pictured, left and right, in Facebook photos) was rushed to St Francis Hospital with serious injuries, including brain swelling, a broken skull, hip and pelvis and bruising on her lung . The fall was not the first notable incident to have occurred at Beta Theta Pi, which is not recognized by Wesleyan University as a fraternity and was once dubbed 'the rape factory' in a lawsuit. In 2010, a student alleged that she was sexually assaulted at the fraternity house, while another claimed to have been raped by a non-student on the premises in 2013, according to WFSB. In Miss Elbardissy's case, police were apparently already at the house investigating a noise complaint when she fell. They were alerted to her fate at around 1.15am on September 7. Miss Elbardissy was reportedly drunk at the time. As the officers waited for medics to arrive at the scene, they had beer poured over them out of a window by fraternity members, it is alleged. Fall: She was forced to undergo intubation and had to relearn how to walk, swallow food and get dressed, it is reported. Above, a clip from a news report at the time. Miss Elbardissy fell out of one of these windows . 'A really nice girl': The fall was not the first notable incident to have occurred at Beta Theta Pi, which is not recognized by Wesleyan University as a fraternity. Above,  Miss Elbardissy is seen in a Facebook photo . Following the incident, Wesleyan ordered students to stay away from the fraternity house, saying it had 'lost confidence in the ability of the fraternity members to manage social activities at the house'. Meanwhile, the national Beta Theta Pi fraternity suspended the Wesleyan Mu Epsilon chapter. It is believed that the fraternity is still out of bounds for students at the private liberal arts college. Now, Miss Elbardissy has filed a lawsuit against the fraternity and Wesleyan via her lawyer. The 24-page document accuses the university of failing to protect her from the dangers at the frat house. It alleges the college turned a blind eye to a number of safety violations at the house - including the roof deck, which the fraternity used 'openly and obviously' - despite warnings from city officials, .

The document accuses the university of failing to protect her from the dangers at the frat house. Fundraising: A GoFundMe page (pictured), set up by Miss Elbardissy's mother, has raised more than $44,000 . This deck, featuring 'unsecured plywood', was negligent, created a public nuisance and led to Miss Elbardissy's fall, claims the lawsuit, which is seeking an unspecified amount of money in damages. Last year, police ruled that the fall was an accident. At the time, Wesleyan said: 'Our thoughts are with the injured student, who is improving, and we hope for a full and speedy recovery.' Eyewitnesses described the incident as 'pretty terrifying' and Miss Elbardissy, 'a really nice girl'. No one has been charged in the incident.

5767,"(CNN)I've been in disaster management long enough to know that there is really no one right way to mark the anniversary of a tragic event. As the Boston Marathon runners begin and, hopefully, finish their exhausting run Monday, the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways. More public safety officials throughout the route, a finish line area that prohibits large bags, National Guard members in full uniform giving some sense of security -- those are the most obvious, visible changes.  And there are less obvious ones too. With the luxury of some time and healing, the city has moved on. And that is a blessing. In the midst of that weeklong tragedy -- the bombings, the manhunt, the lockdown and eventual capture or killing of the Tsarnaev brothers -- we thought we knew what was going on. But we were too much in the midst of our own situational awareness, the fog of war. Sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions. That narrative is just forming, and it's worth going back to highlight some of the more strategic lessons that came out of that week. As a former homeland security adviser for Massachusetts, I was intimately involved with the marathon planning; as a commentator for CNN, I saw the story evolve during that week. Some of these lessons learned are informed by the luxury of time and hindsight, others by various after-action reports and assessments, and others by the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, in which a jury found him guilty of multiple counts. On Tuesday, the trial's sentencing phase will begin, determining whether he will receive the death penalty. In national security circles, there is often a debate about whether the U.S. judicial system is well equipped for terrorism trials. Terrorism, the argument goes, is different from traditional crimes, and our system of evidence and cross-examination and the promise of counsel are not appropriate to transnational threats. Even if this argument were valid in some context -- where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain -- the Boston Marathon trial made clear that the system does work. What was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional. Prosecutors presented evidence. Defense attorneys challenged the witnesses. The defendant chose not to testify. A verdict was rendered. Its simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases, but also took the mythology (maybe even the romanticism) of terrorism out of the case. It rendered Tsarnaev a common criminal. And that was a statement worth making. Recent reports about the shootout in Watertown that Friday night in 2013 show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt. It is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of Massachusetts Transit Police Officer Richard Donohue as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure. Maybe it was adrenaline, maybe it was just the nature of the weapons. What is clear -- in Watertown and in so many other police departments -- is that our police officers are not adequately trained for the kind of weapons that they have now. That is a dangerous gap, and too many police departments are failing to address it. We have a notion of ""Boston Strong"" coming from the attacks and the city's response. I never loved the term, mostly because it makes it seem that our ability to bounce back was because we have Puritan stock and a kick-ass attitude. That is only partially true. We risk believing that responses to tragedy are simply a matter of personal reflection and a ""keep calm"" persona. I have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response. The quick decisions to move runners off Boylston Street, the ability of police officers to seal the large crime zone and to utilize the military to do so, the pivot of public health officials from tending to blisters and dehydration to forming makeshift triage centers. It is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died; the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only. One part of the response that doesn't get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks. Runners had no access to phones, and often had no identification. Family members of runners often didn't know where their loved ones were on the marathon route. First responders, in particular the Boston police and the Red Cross, focused on getting families back together again by moving runners and spectators to Commonwealth Avenue, a few blocks from the finish line. Once family members know that they are with loved ones, the trauma subsides. They often leave the scene, freeing up space and capacity so that public safety can focus on more immediate needs. Crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster: Is my family OK? Obviously, there is so much more to learn. Could the bombing have been avoided? What would have happened if the FBI had shared information it had on the Tsarnaev family with local police? What if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers? It's ""woulda, coulda, shoulda"" but still essential. One of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons isn't simply for blame, but to get better for the next time. Analysis and criticism are necessary to make us stronger and more resilient. But do not believe that we are done learning. Looking back can be risky; it's often called the ""blinding clarity of hindsight"" because everything looks so obvious in the rearview mirror. But I have no doubt that at future anniversaries, what we know today will be altered and reformed and a new narrative might be written. And maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead.","Boston Marathon takes place Monday, two years after bombing, and sentencing phase of trial begins Tuesday .
Kayyem: It wasn't the Puritan ethic but good disaster response that kept the marathon bombing from being even worse ."
983,"Radio DJ Neil Fox forced himself on a girl of 13 at a theme park after she asked him to pose for a photo, it was alleged yesterday. Fox – known to his millions of listeners as Dr Fox – also indecently assaulted two star-struck girls under the age of 16 at a motor show, a court heard. The 53-year-old is accused of a total of nine offences against three girls and three women over 23 years. One alleged victim says Fox repeatedly assaulted her at Capital Radio’s studios in Leicester Square. Scroll down for video . Support: DJ 'Dr' Neil Fox leaves court with his wife Vicky where he denied nine sex attacks on six victims - including three children . Two others say they were sexually touched against their will by him at Magic FM’s studios in Central London. Fox denies seven counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual touching without consent against six females between 1991 and 2014. As the charges were put at Westminster Magistrates Court, his barrister Jonathan Caplan QC asked for reporting restrictions to be lifted because there had been false statements about the charges on social media. Fox, who wore a dark pinstripe suit and was accompanied to court by his wife Vicky, asked for his case to be heard by a district judge at the court, rather than facing a jury trial. Prosecutor Darren Watts told the court: ‘The Crown argue that the complaints show a consistent and determined pattern of sexual predatory behaviour.’ He said Fox, a former Pop Idol judge, allegedly assaulted two girls at a motor show in Bromley, South East London, in the summer of 1991 while appearing there as a DJ. Mr Watts said: ‘In relation to the first allegation the complainant was approximately 13 or 14 years of age. She... asked for a photograph with him and he is said to have kissed her and forced his tongue down into her mouth.’ Fox, who denies sex attacks on women and children, smiles after he left today's hearing . A second teenager alleged Fox kissed her and put his hand up her skirt. The attack on the 13-year-old girl at Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey took place in 1996 and allegedly involved Fox forcing his tongue into her mouth after she asked for a photo. He faces four charges of indecent assault against a former female colleague at Capital Radio, where he worked from 1993 to 2005. The woman claims he squeezed her breasts and would regularly grope her bottom. Fox, of Chelsea, was granted bail and is next due in court on April 30. Fox was first arrested in September last year and the DJ, who categorically denies the allegations, was then questioned for more than seven hours over four alleged offences. At the same time, officers swooped on his £3million home. Darren Watts, prosecuting said: 'In relation to the second allegation the victim was approximately 15, at the same motor show. 'The defendant was present and has again been asked for a photograph, and it is alleged he kissed her - forcing his tongue into her mouth while putting his hand up her skirt and touching her bottom. Mr Watts explained that the next four allegations related to the same victim, a woman over 16 years old, at Capital Radio between 31 January 2003 and 31 December 2003. 'In four separate incidents he has shown unacceptable behaviour,' Mr Watts said. 'The first time he has put his arms around her, squeezing her breasts tightly. 'He would regularly touch her bottom, be that a caress or a squeeze. 'The third incident happened while he was in the recording studio - he bent her over from behind and stimulated sex.' Mr Watts said on the fourth occasion Fox had touched the woman between her legs, albeit over clothing. Defence: Lawyers for the 53-year-old, from Fulham, south west London, said he 'categorically denies' the allegations . The final two allegations of inappropriate touching are said to have taken place at Magic FM between January and November 2007, and March and August 2014. 'The next incident (eighth allegation) happened in the work place,' Mr Watts said. 'It is said the defendant started touching her and putting his hand up her top, exposing her bra and breast.' Suspended: Dr Fox is one of Britain's most famous DJs but has been unable to work since his arrest . Fox then allegedly pushed her onto a sofa and simulated having sex, the court heard. The final incident also took place at Magic, where Fox is said to have approached a woman from behind and said 'Oh, I have just got to,' before kissing her on the shoulder. He allegedly said to her: 'You look as if you taste so good.' Charge one: Indecent assault on a girl under the age of 14 years in Bromley in 1991 . Charge two: Indecent assault on a girl under the age of 16 years in Bromley in 1991 . Charge three: Indecent assault on a girl under the age of 16 years at Chessington World of Adventures in 1996 . Charge four: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge five: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge six: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge seven: Indecent assault on woman over 16 years of age in 2003 at Capital Radio . Charge eight: Sexual assault on a female in 2007 in central London . Charge nine:Sexual assault on a female in 2014 in central London . Mr Caplan said it was 'regrettable' that he had to apply for reporting restrictions to be lifted, but qualified he was doing this to ensure a 'fair trial' for his client. Mr Caplan added that misreporting in the press and on social media as to what the allegations and charges amount to  had 'courted inferences' about the allegations which were 'wholly wrong.' He said the alleged offences amounted to 'inappropriate kissing and touching over clothing.' Mr Fox, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM. There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon. The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival. He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans. Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career. But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade. Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since.

6370,"Alastair Cook may have had a long break working on his batting with his old mentor Graham Gooch but his technical problems very much remain. The England captain, without an international century for almost two years, failed for the second time in the first Test as his old failing against the full ball just outside off-stump was again exploited by West Indies. To compound Cook’s misery, there was also another failure for Jonathan Trott, who has endured a nightmare return to the England team for his 50th Test, 18 months after the trauma of leaving the Ashes tour following his 49th. The double blow at the start of England’s second innings left them with much to do in this first Test to work their way towards a winning position at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium even though they earned a first-innings lead of 104. Cook simply cannot afford many more mistakes, with new ECB chairman Colin Graves demanding victory here over opposition in West Indies he condemned as ‘mediocre’ ahead of this trip. Cook returned to something like his best last year with three half-centuries in his last four Test innings against India but his woeful one-day form in Sri Lanka led England to jettisoning him as 50-over captain ahead of the World Cup. He arrived in the Caribbean still smarting from that blow but with a slightly altered technique and looked refreshed in scoring a warm-up hundred against St Kitts. The step up to Test level, however, has seen Cook struggling and Jerome Taylor looked anything but mediocre in sending both him and Trott back with just 20 on the board as England endured a rocky start to their second innings. Trott has been recalled in the unaccustomed role of opener but has looked jittery in scoring a duck and now four and was noticeably falling over in the crease as he edged a decent ball from Taylor to Denesh Ramdin. Alastair Cook failed with the bat once again on day three of the first Test in Antigua . Jonathan Trott was also out cheaply as the first three wickets once again fell for not many . James Tredwell earlier picked up four wickets as England bowled West Indies out for 295 in their first innings . It is far too early to say that England’s gamble in bringing back a man who left Australia with what was later diagnosed as ‘situational anxiety’ has backfired but Trott will be under significant pressure in the second Test. Cook’s problems have been going on much longer and it is no exaggeration to say that he will be fighting for his job for the rest of this three-match series, particularly with change sweeping through English cricket. Here he pushed forward hesitantly to a ball he could have left alone from Taylor and succeeded only in edging to the delighted Sulieman Benn at slip on 13 after falling for 11 in the first innings. And when Ian Bell, a centurion in the first innings, was run out after a dreadful mix-up with Gary Balance, England had again lost early wickets and were struggling on 52 for three, only 156 ahead. West Indies were very much in the game then but Ballance and Joe Root settled any English nerves with an unbroken stand of 64 which gives them a lead of 220 and puts them in what should be a decisive position. Earlier England had toiled before dismissing West Indies for 295, with the unlikely figure of James Tredwell finishing with four for 47 but Jimmy Anderson only being able to claim one more victim to remain one short of Sir Ian Botham’s England record of 383 Test wickets. Shivnarine Chanderpaul was the first wicket to fall on day three as he was caught by Ben Stokes off Tredwell . Stuart Broad celebrates after claiming the wicket of Denesh Ramdin to leave West Indies on 227 for six . Jermaine Blackwood celebrates his maiden Test match century in his sixth Test match . Alastair Cook has now gone 61 combined Test and ODI innings without making a century. His last ton for England came against New Zealand at Headingley in May 2013, 690 days ago. England fought long and hard before they decided to bring Tredwell on this tour and considered Surrey’s Zafar Ansari and even his veteran team-mate Gareth Batty before they plumped for the likeable yeoman of Kent. Moeen Ali’s absence gave an opportunity to an off-spinner who could not even get into Kent’s championship team last season, the promise of Adam Riley being preferred to him, and Tredwell had to go on loan to Sussex to get a game. Yet Tredwell is reliable, steady and under-stated and England knew he would not let them down when they preferred him to the more naturally talented but inconsistent Adil Rashid for this first Test. The 23-year-old Jamaican scored 112 from 220 deliveries to drag West Indies up to 295 from their first innings . Blackwood takes off his helmet and raises his bat to celebrate a first century in international cricket . Joe Root makes the catch to dismiss Sulieman Benn, who was the last wicket to fall in West Indies' innings . Jermaine Blackwood is a 23-year-old Jamaican middle-order batsman playing in his sixth Test match. What kind of batsman is he? He’s a very aggressive player — he hit James Tredwell for six off his second ball of the innings — but perfectly capable of a well-worked innings. Blackwood has passed 50 four times in his first six Tests, including 56 and 63 against New Zealand and South Africa respectively, not to mention his unbeaten 112. Anything else I need to know? Tredwell isn’t the first Test bowler Blackwood has hit over the rope at the start of his innings. The batsman hit Trent Boult for four and six in his second over against New Zealand. It will be difficult for England to leave him out now, even though Moeen will join the squad in Grenada in time for the second Test, particularly if Tredwell can spin them to victory on this slow Antiguan pitch. It was Tredwell who made the first breakthrough of the day for England and the most important one in persuading the limpet-like Shiv Chanderpaul to chip tamely to extra cover in an off-side dominated field. That should have opened the door for England but they needed to be patient until the last three West Indians fell in 11 balls to a combination of Tredwell, Anderson and sharp work from Stuart Broad to run out Taylor. Throughout it all the diminutive figure of Jermaine Blackwood stood firm for West Indies to go to his maiden hundred in his sixth Test with thrilling but often risky stroke-making. Blackwood severely tried the patience of Ben Stokes, who could have had him three times but ended up wicketless as the 23-year-old Jamaican finished unbeaten on 112. Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Trott for just four after he edged behind to Ramdin . Trott added a score of four to his first innings duck in his first Test since returning after an 18 month absence . Trott makes his way off the field after a disappointing first Test back in the England team . Captain Cook also fell cheaply as he was out for 13 after edging a Taylor delivery into the slips . Ian Bell also lost his wicket late on the third evening as England's first three wickets fell for just 52 runs . Jimmy Anders on will have to wait until West Indies’ second innings to beat Ian Botham’s record Test wicket haul of 383. The Lancashire fast bowler took 2 for 67 in the first innings — after Devon Smith was caught behind on Tuesday, Anderson dismissed tail-ender Sulieman Benn with a length ball deflected to short leg. Benn was Anderson’s first wicket caught at short leg since New Zealand’s Iain O’Brien at Old Trafford in 2008 — his 78th Test wicket. It was Blackwood who was reprieved by Stokes overstepping on the second evening when he was caught at slip and it was the same man who survived when he was dropped by the diving Tredwell on 43 and then when he edged Stokes through the vacant second slip on 80. For Anderson this was another frustrating day, with little reverse swing on offer, but he did move a big step closer to the record when he had last man Benn caught by Root at short leg. Yet the ultimate English frustration belonged to Cook and Trott.","England closed day three of the first Test on 116 for three, 220 runs ahead .

4524,"A Briton jailed in Burma for using an image of the Buddha to promote his bar has been ‘abandoned’ by the Foreign Office, according to human rights campaigners. Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour by a Burmese court last month after posting the mocked-up image of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook. The tongue-in-cheek advert for a cheap-drinks night at the VGastro bar in Rangoon provoked outrage among devout Buddhists. Scroll down for video . Phil Blackwood (left) was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour by a Burmese court last month after posting a mocked-up image of Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook. Human rights campaigners claim he has been 'abandoned' by the Foreign Office . The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion along with the bar’s Burmese owner and another manager, despite apologising profusely for posting the picture. All three were given the same sentence. MPs and human rights campaigners said Mr Blackwood, who is married with a young daughter, is enduring appalling conditions in the notorious Insein prison. They also claimed the British Government had ‘turned its back’ on Mr Blackwood, who lived in Middlesbrough until his family moved to New Zealand when he was four. The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion because of this picture . In a Commons answer, a Foreign Office Minister admitted he was not aware Mr Blackwood was a British citizen. Last night, his father Brian insisted that the family had informed the British authorities of his son’s dual nationality after his arrest. Although New Zealand diplomats were taking the lead, he said that the family expected the Foreign Office to exert pressure on Burma. Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald said: 'Philip Blackwood has been unjustly imprisoned for an honest mistake for which he has already issued a heartfelt apology. 'As a British citizen, rather than turning their back on Mr Blackwood, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office should be pulling every available leaver to secure his immediate and unconditional release so that he can return to his family.' There is international concern over a surge of religious nationalism in Burma, ruled until recently by a military junta. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘Our ambassador in Burma made clear that we were following the case closely when he raised it with the Burmese Minister of the Presidency. ‘Our embassy in Rangoon has provided advice and support to the New Zealanders on Mr Blackwood’s case.’","Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour .

2938,"Nigel Farage was booed by the audience of last night's live television debate after complaining of a ‘total lack of comprehension’ from those in attendance. The Ukip leader risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were ‘a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC’. His outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching. Scroll down for video . Booed: Ukip leader Nigel Farage risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC' Explanation: Mr Farage was heckled before David Dimbleby (pictured), who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say how the audience had been chosen . He said: ‘There just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel, and indeed amongst this audience, which is a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC.’ Mr Farage was heckled by members of the audience before David Dimbleby, who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say: ‘Nigel, let me just say one thing. ‘This is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the BBC, but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband gave the Ukip leader the advice: ‘It's never a great idea to attack the audience, Nigel, in my opinion.’ But Mr Farage retorted: ‘The real audience are sitting at home.' Jeering: Mr Farage's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching . Left alone: Mr Farage (right) stands alone while the other four leaders go up to each other following the debate . Which political leader won the latest TV debate? Which political leader won the latest TV debate? Now share your opinion . Mr Farage said: 'A rapid rise in population due to open door immigration... has directly contributed to the housing crisis. 'If you have net migration running at 300,000 a year, that's 300,000 people who need somewhere to live.' Miss Sturgeon won loud applause as she urged Mr Farage to 'put the bogeyman to one side'. She told him: 'We have a housing crisis across this country. You know what, Nigel Farage? It isn't caused by immigrants. In your world every problem is caused by immigrants.' The BBC insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night. A spokesman for the corporation told MailOnline yesterday: 'ICM recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion.' ICM, a public opinion research company founded in 1989, was unavailable for comment last night. Ukip meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen. Asked after the debate about Mr Farage's criticism of the audience, Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'I am not sure whether we will complain. All I will say is I didn't think the audience was representative of the views of British people. 'I think Nigel Farage would have done very well with people sitting at home.' Mr Nuttall said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on Question Time, telling reporters: 'Who knows, may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms.' At the debate: (From left) Labour Party leader Ed Miiband, Plaid Cymru Party leader Leanne Wood, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon and Mr Farage . Unimpressed: Ukip voter Mike Cripps, 44 . A Ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after Nigel Farage attacked the studio audience. Security worker Mike Cripps, 44, of Bromley, south-east London, believed the Ukip leader had ‘done a couple of stupid things’. The first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with HIV visiting the UK for NHS treatment, Mr Cripps said. Asked if Mr Farage's remarks had put him off supporting Ukip, Mr Cripps said: ‘It did a bit, yeah. I don't think he put himself across right. ‘If we're just talking about the debate tonight - it's what we should be talking about, not what he's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me, Nicola Sturgeon was the best. ‘She was slick, she was well prepared, she had been well briefed, that's my personal opinion. Ed Miliband - it was like he was reading off a script.’ Asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to Ukip's views, he added: 'Oh no. People at home agree with us and that's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this. 'We know, for example, on immigration, on the European Union they agree with where Ukip stands. What the audience in here really think is, I suppose, irrelevant.' Tweeting during the debate, Lord Ashcroft said: 'A minority view once again. Nigel Farage having a go at the BBC audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting.' And Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Farage having a pop at balance of audience. Dodgy ground there. Broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair.' Also speaking at the debate - three weeks before the General Election - were Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, Green leader Natalie Bennett and Nicola Sturgeon from the Scottish National Party. Miss Sturgeon later mocked Mr Farage's attempt to 'win friends and influence people'. Five questions were asked by the audience during the BBC ‘challengers’ debate, with each of the five leaders also making a short opening and closing statement. The first clash of the evening came between Mr Miliband and Mr Farage with the Labour leader saying that Ukip's sums for clearing the deficit ‘don't add up’. But Mr Farage said: ‘Our sums do add up. You obviously haven't read the manifesto.' As the end credits rolled following the BBC debate last night, four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but Mr Farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand. As Miss Bennett and Miss Wood walked away, Miss Sturgeon then went to shake Mr Farage's hand - and Mr Miliband offered the Ukip leader a pat on the back. Then, all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception, again, of Mr Farage. He shook hands with Mr Dimbleby before leaving without going up to the audience.

This action shot was taken at Estavayer-le-Lac in Switzerland where the latest water sports craze of Jet Surfing has taken off. The contraption can be seen leaping up above the surface, almost resembling scenes from the film Back to the Future where Michael J Fox's character Marty McFly climbs on to a futuristic hoverboard. Scroll down for video . Flying high: Jet surfing is the latest craze in extreme water sports as thrillseekers take it to the next level .

Futuristic: The jet-surfing looks like Marty McFly's famous hoverboard from the Back to the Future series, although Michael J Fox's character was unable to get across the water with his board . But unlike in the 1985 classic, this Jet Surf board, made in the Czeck Republic, is designed for travelling across water - and is so powerful it can help propel riders into the air off waves or the wake from passing boats. Jet surf boards have a top speed of 33mph and weigh just 15kg. Its makers say the sport is easy to master and that the boards are nimble and responsive. It is equipped with a specially-designed two-stroke engine which uses up to two litres of fuel an hour depending on the model and conditions. Extreme: Jet surf boards have a top speed of 33mph and weigh just 15kg. Its makers say the sport is easy to master and that the boards are nimble and responsive . A bit more traditional: The surfers can get down to the water if they fancy something a little more sedate . The risks and dangers are minimal mainly because of the light weight design and the auto cut-out feature which stops the engine as soon as the rider lets go of the handle, according to a spokesman . A spokesman from the company, said: 'The experience of Jet surfing is exactly what it sounds like - surfing with jet power. 'It's a massive adrenaline rush to accelerate on a board which, in terms of the power to weight ratio and the lack of friction, is one of the most powerful craft of any type in the world.

'If there is some wake from a boat or a choppy surface then it's full of kickers and jumps where riders can get some serious air, allowing big grabs, tweaks, method airs and even back flips.' Jet surfing is less risky and dangerous than other extreme sports, according to the company. The spokesman said: 'The risks and dangers are minimal mainly because of the light weight design and the auto cut-out feature which stops the engine as soon as the rider lets go of the handle. 'Obviously, we recommend surfers ride within their limits and wear life vests and helmets, also to stay aware of prevailing water conditions and respect other water users.'","Motorised surfboards weigh just 15kg and travel at speeds of up to 33mph .

2821,"Pensioners and neighbours have criticised the £750,000 refurbishment of sheltered accommodation which they say has made it look like Legoland. All of the 36 units at the Redlands House sheltered accommodation have been given the colourful treatment which has been labelled an 'eyesore' by local residents. But the local council defended the colour scheme, claiming it will help residents with poor eyesight find their way home. Graham White, 76, from Penarth said the changes to the property looks 'more like a children's playscheme' The 36 homes as they were before the council spent £750,000 including funds from the Intermediate Care Fund on the renovation . One pensioner, Graham White, 76, said residents think the property looks 'more like a children's playscheme than sheltered accommodation'. Mr White, who has lived in one of the flats for three years, told the BBC: 'It is a total waste of public money. The colours are totally unsuitable for the older people that live here. 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' The residents' rent, of £103 a week plus bills, has remained the same since before the refurbishments took place. One neighbour, who lives opposite Redlands House and who did not wish to be named, described the building as an 'eyesore'. She said: 'It would be great if it was for kids. If it was a nursery it would look lovely. It looked much better the way it was before they put the colour on it.' However Sue Barter, who lives on Redlands Avenue, said she was 'not indifferent to it'. She said: 'I can see how residents might not like it. It's a shame it is not somewhere where more people can see it and appreciate it. But I wouldn't complain about it.' Hayley Selway, head of housing for Vale of Glamorgan council said the aim of the refurbishment was to 'change the look and feel of the property and bring it into the 21st century'. Mr White said after the colourful renovations that: 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' She said: 'It is quite loud and vibrant. The design won't suit everyone's tastes and not everybody is going to like it. 'This was about making a statement saying this is somewhere a little bit different.' She said the vibrant colours, both internal and external, were chosen to help residents with low levels of dementia and those with sight problems. She said plans for the redevelopment were on display for residents before any construction began and no concerns were raised prior to the work starting. She said: 'It is a matter of taste. Some residents rave about it. For others it is a huge departure from where they lived before but not everybody hates it.' Not impressed: Mr White stands outside the newly refurbished flats where he has lived for more than 3 years .","Locals say the bizarre refurbishment is more suitable for a playground .

4162,"Holden have been left red-faced after having to recall more than 26,000 of its vehicles because they could be at risk of catching alight. After five customers reported having 'thermal incidents', Holden issued a stop delivery notice to car dealers and urged owners of the Holden Colorado- SUV or ute- to have their cars checked out immediately. Spanning just over a year, the models said to be affected were made in Thailand between September 2013 and January 2015. After five customers reported having 'thermal incidents', Holden issued a stop delivery notice to car dealers and urged owners of the Holden Colorado- SUV or ute- to have their cars checked out immediately . This latest safety issue makes Holden the most recalled car brand in 2015. Last year, Holden shared the title of most recalls with Jeep after issuing 14 notices to recall around nine vehicles- including the Holden Barina, the Holden Cruze and the Holden TJ Trax- amid safety concerns. A website run by the federal government confirmed there is a risk 'cable insulation' in the Colorado 'may melt of catch fire.' Holden said the issue is caused by an alternator cable making unnecessary contact with a steel bracket on the battery tray. They said under certain driving conditions the movement of the engine could cause the cable to rub through the insulation, potentially causing a short circuit. This latest safety issue makes Holden the most recalled car brand in 2015, with five recalls in only four months . 'If the short circuit creates sufficient heat, there is a risk that the cable insulation may melt or potentially catch fire,' Holden told Newscorp in a statement. Holden said drivers should look out for warning signs that their car may be affected, like a battery warning light on the dash board, or in more serious cases a 'small amount of smoke' seen coming from the engine bay. Earlier this month, Holden recalled the Korean-made Captiva after concerns that the SUV may lurch forward if the key was left in the ignition for too long. This brings Holden to a total of five recalls in the first four months of this year. Holden revealed that if the short circuit creates sufficient heat, there is a risk that the cable insulation may melt or potentially catch fire (Stock photo) This comes as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced figures that show the number of safety recalls in Australia are steadily on the rise. The ACCC monitored 307 recalls in 2014, a 14 per cent increase from 2013 where they only monitored 268 recalls. The figures show there has been a consistent increase in recalls dating back to 2010. Recalls the ACCC have monitored in Australia included a punching bag that contained nails and needles, a vacuum that put users at risk of electric shock and burns, an 'egg free' ice cream that contained egg whites and a spear gun that fired without warning. Senator Madigan, a former Democratic Labor Party representative told Farifax he blamed the rise in recalls on a 'systemic regulatory failure' to protect Australians from substandard imported products. 'There is definitely more faulty stuff around, but I do think that people are becoming a little bit more aware, and sick of it. There's a lot of these cheap places where you can go and buy cheap stuff, but it's not cheap if it doesn't last,' he warned.","Holden recalled 26,000 Colorado's as they are at risk of catching alight .

'The university has concluded its business with CTI and, therefore, is no longer bound by its confidentiality agreement with the agency,' the university said in a statement. It was CTI, however, that initially opposed the disclosure after the Houston Chronicle filed a FOIA request concerning the fee--which will be paid through taxes and tuition. The booking agency argued a 'reporter or someone' might create 'unfair negatives online,' the Chronicle reports. The university will also pay a 15 percent booking fee to CTI, or $20,250. The university did not divulge the fees it's paid to previous speakers, though it is not uncommon for schools to pay celebrities and other biog name speakers top dollar.

4523,"A husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded £160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded £9,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given £9,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today, Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.'

8634,"Javier Hernandez made it six goals in eight starts as Real Madrid kept up their pursuit of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo. Chicharito is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of Leo Messi who nets once every 81 minutes. The Manchester United loanee put his team in the Champions League semi-finals in midweek with the winner against Atletico Madrid and in Baliados on Sunday night he scored twice to keep Real in the title race. And if his goal at the Bernabeu was a tired shot with the goal gaping in the dying minutes, his strikes against Celta Vigo were of the highest quality and will only serve to ramp up the auction for his services at the end of the season – who knows if his goals bring trophies to the Santiago Bernabeu, Real might even be in the race to sign him permanently. Javier Hernandez scored two more important goals for Real Madrid as they look to keep up with Barcelona in the quest for the La Liga crown .

Colombian international midfielder James Rodriguez celebrates his strike and the visitors third goal with Hernandez (left) The Real Madrid players surround striker Hernandez (No 14) after his first goal brought Carlo Ancelotti's men back into the lead . The game was the perfect tonic for anyone who had sat through Arsenal v Chelsea earlier on Sunday. Both sides flew forward from the off and their ambition was rewarded though for Real Madrid the reward was ultimately far greater. They fell behind after nine minutes when former Barcelona player Nolito took advantage of poor Real Madrid defending. Sergio Ramos lost his boot and was reduced to running back towards goal with it in his hand. And without him Rafael Varane, Alvaro Carvajal and Asier Illaramendi all failed to stop Nolito as he tricked his way in from the left-hand channel and shot past Iker Casillas. Real Madrid responded on the quarter-hour when Cristiano Ronaldo crossed from the right. The ball was cleared straight to Toni Kroos who picked his spot well to fire Madrid level with his second goal of the season. On 24 minutes Real were ahead and it was man of the moment in the Spanish capital Hernandez who got the goal. Rodriguez was involed in the build-up but he still had plenty to do when he received the ball cutting in from the right to shoot past Sergio Alvarez. Celta Vigo, hoping to do their former coach Luis Enrique a big favour, did not retreat and they were level on the half hour when 19-year-old Santi Mina raced away from Madrid’s defence on to a pass from Fabian Orellana. The teenager scored from the rebound after his first shot came back off the post.

Double goal scorer on the night Hernandez (right) tries to round a diving Celta goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez (left) Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo (left) fights for the ball against Celta's Augusto Fernandez but was unable to add to his impressive tally . The game was chaotic in every sense and Sergio Ramos and Joaquin Larrivey both needed lengthy treatment after a clash of heads. Ronaldo was linking well with James Rodriguez and Hernandez and almost put Real ahead but saw his shot come back off the post after another fine pass from Chicharito. When the goal that put Real Madrid ahead did come it was again made by Ronaldo. He played in James Rodriguez and his deflected shot beat Alvarez to leave Celta Vigo going down the tunnel at half time stunned to have played so well in attack and yet still find themselves behind. Their front three of ex-Barça B forward Nolito, journeyman centre-forward Larrivey and teenage prospect Mina, aided by Orellana, had run Real’s back four ragged and they kept the pressure up in the second half. It was Orellana who wend down under a challenge from behind from Kroos at the start of the second half but the referee was unmoved by the home side’s appeals. Isco went close for Real Madrid and then Ronaldo raced away on another counter-attack, which ended with a pass to Hernandez, he tried to hit the shot first time and, falling as he made contact, blasted it high and wide. He would get another chance however and this time he would take it. Celta were playing football that made a mockery of the financial gulf between the two sides. Their wage bill is €12m compared with the €17m Real pay Ronaldo but they were inevitable leaving themselves wide open on the counter and they were also tiring badly. It was perhaps the fatigue that meant they allowed Sergio Ramos to bring the ball out from the back without a Celta player anywhere near him. Ramos picked out Hernandez with a long pass forward and he controlled it with his first touch before slotting past Alvarez with an emphatic second. A week ago he was a frustrated squad player. Now with the season approaching its climax he looks like one of Real Madrid's most important players.","Javier Hernandez scored twice to keep Real Madrid in touching distance of La Liga leaders Barcelona .

Hollywood glamour: The collection, Sirens' Call, featured intricate wedding gowns with with hand-beaded detailing . Spotlight: Johnson said ahead of the show that she intended to 'bring a little bit of Hollywood to Sydney' 'I wanted it to be a celebration in terms of bringing a little bit of Hollywood to Sydney,' Johnson said.

605,"Kellie Maloney, pictured at Ukip's spring conference in February, now says that a vote for the party is 'wasted' Kellie Maloney has said that a vote for Ukip is a wasted vote. The celebrity former boxing promoter, formerly known as Frank, is one of the party's most famous former candidates. But she warned Ukip supporters should vote Tory to keep Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon out of power. She told Sky News: 'If we want to stop Labour and the SNP I think you’ve got to vote Tory. A vote for Ukip would be quite wasted I believe. 'I know Ukip are not going to like hearing that, but if they’re honest they would say the same things as well because they’re not going to get enough seats to wield any power. 'I think they’ll get four or five seats, maybe.' She praised Ukip leader Nigel Farage, adding: 'You can’t knock him.' But she warned how other candidates have given the party a bad image. She said: 'There is free speech (in the party) but some of the stuff that comes out from some of the Ukip people. 'I mean no normal person in the street could accept that and I think that is their downfall. 'They could offer some great things to the British public had they sat down and done it right and they weeded out the bad and brought in more people through the ranks.' The former boxing promoter, who stood as the party's candidate for London Mayor in 2004, has just undergone a full gender re-assignment. Speaking about transgender people, she said: 'We are probably where the gay community was 25 years ago and we can learn a lot from them. 'But it would be nice to hear political parties speak up on civil rights and gender issues.' Mr Farage last night dismissed the criticism. He told Sky News: 'There is a fear about Labour and the SNP and that’s why I’m talking to you from Hartlepool because whats happened over the last couple of weeks is there is a strengthening in the Ukip polls and its all coming from Labour. 'So the way to stop Labour/SNP coalition is for Labour voters to switch and vote for Ukip.' When Miss Maloney was standing to London Mayor, she caused controversy by claiming there were 'too many gays' in Camden. She apologised for the homophobic remarks when she addressed Ukip's spring conference in February this year. The criticism is a blow for Ukip leader Nigel Farage who had hoped that Miss Maloney's backing would help to change the image of the party . Mr Farage will today campaign in Hartlepool, where he thinks the party has its best chance of winning in the North East at the election. The seat has been put on Ukip’s list of top ten targets. Other seats outside of the south of England on the list are Great Grimsby, Boston & Skegness, Dudley North and Heywood & Middleton. Mr Farage last night said he believed Ukip could 'smash up' Labour's 'one-party state' in the North. In an article for MailOnline he said Mr Miliband's party 'simply do not understand' the impact mass immigration has had on people's lives. He accused shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna of calling Ukip racist because Labour is 'running scared' of Ukip. Ukip’s strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the North. In 2010 the party failed to achieve even a single second place. The Hartlepool constituency has been held by Labour since it was formed in 1974. In 2010, Ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and Labour’s Iain Wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority. He replaced Peter Mandelson as the MP in a by-election in 2004 after the Labour grandee stood down to become a European Commissioner. Mr Farage’s hopes for electoral victory in Hartlepool come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002. Stuart Drummond stood as ‘H'Angus the Monkey’, Hartlepool United FC’s mascot, as a publicity stunt with the slogan, ‘free bananas for schoolchildren’. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012. Hartlepool's residents are famously said to have hanged a monkey during the Napoleonic wars because they thought it was a French spy.","Star formerly known as Frank is one of the party's most famous backers .

10425,"Two TSA employees have been fired after they used the airport body scanner inappropriately to allow the male worker to fondle male passengers' genitals. The pair allegedly worked as a team to manipulate the results of a full body scanner at a security check-point in Denver International Airport last year, CBS4 reported. According to a Denver Police Department report seen by Daily Mail Online, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) received an anonymous tip in November last year that an employee had admitted to 'groping' men who came through security. Scroll down for video . The male employee and a female accomplice allegedly worked as a team to manipulate the TSA screening system at Denver International airport in 2014 . According to the report: 'When a male he finds attractive comes to be screened by the scanning machine, he will alert another TSA screener to indicate to the scanning computer that the party being screened is female. 'When the screener does this, the scanning machine will indicate an anomaly in the genital area.' The male TSA employee would then perform pat downs of the male passenger's genitals at the Colorado airport. Despite receiving an employee tip-off to the alleged sexual assaults in November, the TSA only investigated in February. A TSA supervisor told police that he saw the male employee 'give a signal' then after the screening device showed the anomaly 'conduct a pat down of the passenger's front groin and buttocks area with the palms of his hands... contradictory to TSA searching policy'. The female employee was questioned and admitted she had taken part in the assaults on unsuspecting passengers a total of 11 times. Both employees were fired following the incident. The TSA said that efforts to find the male Southwest Airlines passenger who was targeted had been unsuccessful. No other complaints have been made. Denver Police Department were unable to file criminal charges because no victims had been identified. The TSA refused to provide the names of the employees involved. The agency told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday: 'These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable. TSA has removed the two officers from the agency. 'All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.'

5263,"In Afghanistan, many girls are forbidden from riding bicycles - they are, however, allowed to ride skateboards. So when Australian skateboarder Oliver Percovich created Skateistan, a non-profit organization that aims to connect youth in Afghanistan with education through skateboarding, it shouldn't have been a surprise that 40 per cent of the program's students would be girls. In 2012, photographer Jessica Fulford-Dobson decided to take pictures of these Middle Eastern skater girls, and her work was recently on display at a gallery in London. Scroll down for video . Tough girls: Photographer Jessica Fulford-Dobson took pictures of young girls skateboarding in dresses and skirts in Kabul, Afghanistan . Finding time for fun: Most girls are not allowed to ride bikes in Afghanistan, but skateboarding isn't against the rules . According to Feature Shoot, when Mr. Percovich first brought the program to Kabul, Afghanistan in 2007, many of the locals had never even heard of skateboarding. In fact, Ms. Fulford-Dobson said she believes the reason skateboarding has been received so differently in Afghanistan than in other countries is precisely because it was new to the region. 'When skateboarding arrived in Afghanistan, it didn't have any preconceived images for them. They didn't know what it was,' she said, while adding that it was only accepted after it became clear that it was just 'a toy to have fun with'. Safety first: While the girls were conservatively dressed, they didn't forgo safety measures like wearing helmets and knee pads . Little ladies who skate: Ms. Fulford-Dobson said she was fascinated with just how immaculate one girl, left, was, considering how dusty the skateboard facilities were . This sport knows no gender: 40 per cent of Skateistan's students are female; the girls also have the option of joining a back-to-school program . Now, its the top sport for girls in the country, who are able to ride freely in dresses and other clothing that can be restrictive when playing other sports. When Ms. Fulford-Dobson visited the Skateistan facilities in 2012, she quickly noticed their confidence and the joy they took in learning. She took pictures of them with natural light, capturing them in dresses, pants, headscarves and sneakers as they happily played on skateboards. 'I captured about nine in total,' she told the BBC, recalling one girl whose father had initially told her she couldn't join the skateboarding program. He finally relented after she wouldn't stop begging him. Girls will be girls: Ms. Fulford-Dobson said she was struck by the girls' confidence and how happy they were to skateboard . Unconventional athletic gear: The style of dress required by girls can make it difficult to play other sports, but luckily it doesn’t tend to interfere with their skateboarding . 'I met so many impressive women and girls in Afghanistan: a teacher as tough and determined as any man; young Afghans in their early twenties who were volunteering at an orphanage and were passionate about being seen as strong and willing to fight for themselves, rather than as victims of circumstance; and girls who were being educated to be leaders in their communities and who were already thinking carefully about their own and their country’s future,'  Ms. Fulford-Dobson said. That education is a top priority for Skateistan, as many children in Kabul from low-income families are forced to drop out of school to earn money. Besides being taught to skateboard, the program's participants are also invited to join a free back-to-school program to help them get back on track with their education.","Photographer Jessica Fulford-Dobson took pictures of the girls at the Skateistan facilities in Kabul .

5960,"(CNN)Seven minutes after an Aurora, Colorado, theatergoer called 911 to report a massacre in progress, suspect James Holmes surrendered to police, a dozen dead bodies allegedly in his wake. On Monday, jurors will thoroughly examine those seven minutes in a trial that experts say could last months. The prosecution has said it will seek the death penalty. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Jurors will also be asked to consider events that occurred before and after the July 20, 2012, shooting -- namely, evidence that appears to show Holmes planned his attack, even going so far as to buy his movie ticket 12 days before, along with police allegations that officers who arrived to search Holmes' apartment had to navigate booby traps incorporating gasoline and grenades. According to police, Holmes attended the midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" at the Century Aurora 16 Multiplex Theater but left through a rear door alongside the movie screen, propping it open behind him. Holmes returned in ""head-to-toe protective gear,"" including a gas mask, about 18 minutes into the movie, police said, and threw two tear gas canisters into the theater before opening fire with an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one .40-caliber handgun. The attack killed 12 people and wounded another 70, a level of violence not seen in Colorado since the Columbine High School shooting. Five days later, authorities discovered a package in a University of Colorado-Denver mail room that police say Holmes apparently sent. Colorado authorities had no previous contact with Holmes, outside of a 2011 speeding summons, and he graduated in 2010 from the University of California, Riverside, with highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. He enrolled as a doctoral candidate in the University of Colorado School of Medicine's neuroscience program in 2011 but dropped out the following year without providing a reason, according to a university spokeswoman. Holmes faces 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges, but there have already been some notable legal battles in the run-up to the actual trial. In March 2013, Holmes offered to plead guilty so he could avoid the death penalty, a deal the district attorney declined. A few months later, a judge ruled that Holmes had to be restrained during the trial, via a hidden harness anchored to the floor. The defense filed an objection, conceding that Holmes exacted the violence but blaming his actions on mental illness. ""Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by movie goers on July 20, 2012,"" the motion said. Judge Carlos Samour last year ordered Holmes to submit to an additional sanity exam, saying that the previous test, conducted in 2013 at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo, was ""incomplete and inadequate."" Jury selection began in January, and after a four-month process, 12 jurors and alternates, composed of 19 women and five men, were selected.","James Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2012 theater shooting .

A group of 15 men were arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate'.last week after 12 Christians from Ghana and Nigeria were allegedly thrown off a rubber dinghy into the Mediterranean Sea. Survivors from the boat, made up of 105 migrants from diverse religions and ethnicities, have now claimed the men tried to throw other Christians off the side of the vessel after an argument about religion - but were prevented because they huddled together to create a human chain.

Pictured: A migrant looks on after disembarking from a tug boat in Trapani . Fifteen men were arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate'.last week after 12 Christian men from Ghana and Nigeria were allegedly thrown into the Mediterranean Sea . Yeboah, from Ghana, told police in Palmero that he boarded a dinghy in Libya heading to Sicily last Saturday and said the men threw three of his friends and six others into the water. He said: ‘About a day and a half into the crossing, at a certain point some Muslims started to rail against us Christians just because we practiced a different religion. 'Many said that they should throw us into the sea. After the threats we found ourselves in open sea and not long after they started to throw some Christians in the sea.’ He added: 'They tried to throw me and the other Christians still on board as well but they didn't manage to because we held onto the boat and clung onto each other', according to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. 'We resisted for an hour and only stopped when the rescue boat arrived.’ Another survivor Augustin told the newspaper that one of the alleged killers was bitten on his foot by one of the people he had thrown overboard, which helped police identify him. He said: ‘On Sunday evening spontaneously, the people that spoke French began to rage against the Ghanaians and the Nigerians. The men were allegedly killed more than a day into the journey, when an argument started about religion. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centres after landing in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily . 'I don’t know why maybe because there were too many of us on board. One of us understood what they were saying that they wanted to throw us into the sea. 'Soon afterwards they threw three Nigerians and six Ghanaians into the sea, after desperate attempts by each one not to be thrown overboard.' Augustin added that each victim was beaten first, and that he saw each one drown because every time someone was thrown overboard the driver stopped the dingy. The 15 migrants arrested over the attack on their arrival in Palermo are from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau. The police statement said their motive for the attack was that the victims 'professed the Christian faith while the aggressors were Muslim.' The revelation about last week's incident follows news than more than 700 migrants are feared dead after a boat heading for Malta sank in the Mediterranean this weekend. A rescue operation coordinated by the Italian coast guard involving 18 ships is still underway in the hopes of rescuing more people from the midnight sinking off the Libyan coast, 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa.","Boat travelling from Libya to Sicily when 12 Christians thrown overboard .

5131,"Easter is over for the wild rabbits of greater Sydney as councils and parks prepare another attempt to kill them off with strategically placed carrots that have been laced with a deadly virus. Public land managers are desperate to reduce the most recent 'significantly rampant population' of the pest, which causes millions of dollars of major agricultural and environmental damage each year. 'This year, because of really high summer rainfall - which led to great food availability - there has been a big surge in the rabbit population in Sydney. They are really abundant,' Graham Wilson, the manager of biosecurity at Greater Sydney Local Land Services, told Daily Mail Australia. Feral rabbits, which are deemed a pest in NSW, are liekly to br targeted with the Calicivirus, also known as Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), in May . It comes after over 30 government bodies scattered carrots laced with calicivirus around public areas in March . 'The way we introduce the calicivirus in rabbit populations is first we chop regular carrots up and distribute them to different areas and see if they are going to eat them. 'Then, the virus is produced in a laboratory with spreading agents and its mixed with carrots - so that it's coating the carrots - and then we take them and give them to councils to put out where they want.' While rabbits under one year old have a higher chance of surviving, about 70-100 per cent of rabbits die once infected with the calicivirus, also known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), which damages the animal's liver and gut and causes haemorrhaging and bleeding. The program has been implemented annually for the last nine years as a way of managing the pests and 'bringing the population back down again before damage becomes too severe,' Mr Wilson said. 'In other parts of NSW this virus spreads naturally, but you get bushland fragmented by houses and things in urban areas so we are just artificially introducing it into these places.' The feral animals compete with native wildlife for food and habitat and are believe to be responsible for the extinction of and population decline of a number of mammals. They also damage vegetation and prevent its regeneration by feasting on seedlings. About 30 public land managers and councils in Sydney, across 160 localities, scattered the infected vegetable in public areas in March, but a second smaller scale program is likely to be implemented in May across 10 areas as well as the Central Coast. 'It's just because in some areas the numbers have shown the rabbit populations haven't gone down as much as we'd like,' Mr WIlson said. Pet owners are being urged to vaccinate their domestic rabbits, but Mr Wilson assured the virus does not harm cats, dogs or humans. Rabbits were introduced to Australia by the British settlers in the First Fleet. They breed quickly, producing up to five litters of five young each year, and can be found right across Australia in various habitats . 'It's important that people who own pet rabbits vaccinate for calicivirus now to ensure that if their domestic rabbit comes in contact with the virus, which is mainly spread by contact between other rabbits and insects, they are immune.' While there are fears of immunity building in local populations, a test ahead of this year's program implementation found only 20 per cent of the local population was immune. 'This means you'd get about an 80 per cent population reduction and that makes a big difference in terms of the damage that they're doing,' Mr Wilson said. Rabbits were introduced to Australia by the British settlers with the First Fleet. They breed quickly, producing up to five litters of five young each year, and can be found right across Australia in various habitats.","Rabbit populations are rampant in greater Sydney due to high summer rain .

8814,"Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season - even though he may not be around to parade them. The interim Ibrox manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign after being lured back to his old club to kick-start their faltering promotion bid. So far, everything is going to plan with Gers second in the Scottish Championship table and destined for a semi-final play-off slot. Stuart McCall says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season, though he may not be at Rangers . But with 12 players out of contract, McCall knows the Light Blues will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals Celtic next season - if they go up - and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals. He said: 'I've been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when... Even if I'm not here, if I'm getting players put to me who would like to come to Rangers regardless of the manager, then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year. 'It's not a case of us standing still and then thinking come June 1, 'Oh we need to get into action'. 'No, there are a lot of agents who come to us and we build a little dossier of players that as a staff, we think will be good for next season, regardless of what league we are in. 'It would be slightly naive [if we were not doing that]. If I'm in charge or not, I still want the club to do well and I will put my view across to the board on who I think should be coming into the club and who should be here.' McCall is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible position . Rangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re-emerging from the embers of liquidation. The club's team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous Craig Whyte regime and former boss Ally McCoist was largely forced to turn to a list of former Ibrox servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad. But McCall revealed the club's new board are now starting the process of re-establishing their spying network - albeit on a smaller level than before. 'I think there has been discussions behind the scenes with different people,' said the former Motherwell boss. 'I don't think we are at the stage where we were 10 or 15 years ago where we were aiming to get into the Champions League and bringing players in for three and four million yet. 'I don't think Rangers will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere. Rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years . 'But certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place. 'Having said that, I spoke to Craig Levein at Hearts and they do a lot of their scouting with [online service] Wyscout. When I brought Henrik Ojamaa in at Motherwell, that was after I'd seen a clip of him on YouTube. I sold him for £350,000 after signing him for nothing. That was great. 'So you can still do your own background work. Personally I would always like to see the player myself. I've only ever signed one player without watching him first and slightly regretted it. 'So yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where Rangers are, not to the extent where we have scouts all over Europe.' McCall admitted he still does not know if he will rejoin Gordon Strachan's Scotland staff for the June 13 Euro 2016 qualifier with Ireland in Dublin. And he also confessed to uncertainties ahead of Saturday's match with Falkirk. McCall's side are still in line for promotion, sitting in the play-off positions in the Scottish Championship . Peter Houston's Bairns - five points behind fourth-placed Queen of the South with two games to play - need an unlikely series of results to make the play-offs but McCall says that raises more questions than answers. He said: 'Housty is a wily old fox who has done terrifically well in his career so I don't know what to expect. 'It will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play-offs so I don't know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free. 'They don't lose many goals so we may have to be patient through the 90 minutes. We have had a couple of decent results against them but they have capable players and we will need to be at our best.'","Rangers are currently second in the Scottish Championship .

10104,"The SNP will help make Ed Miliband Prime Minister even if Labour finish 40 seats behind the Tories at the general election, Nicola Sturgeon said last night. The Scottish First Minister said she would form an anti-Tory alliance with Labour and other smaller parties regardless of how many MPs David Cameron wins on May 7. While Mr Miliband has ruled out going into coalition with the SNP, Ms Sturgeon's remarks raise the prospect of Labour ruling as a minority government - despite winning fewer votes and seats than the Tories. Protesters wearing masks of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon hold placards outside Chatham House, a foreign affairs think-tank, where Labour leader Ed Miliband delivered a speech in London this morning . The SNP could win as many as 50 MPs in Scotland - allowing Mr Miliband to become Prime Minister even if he falls far short of a majority. Her comments came as Labour slipped four points behind the Tories in the latest polls - with David Cameron's Tories moving to 36 per cent. However, the SNP could win as many as 50 MPs in Scotland - allowing Mr Miliband to become Prime Minister even if he falls far short of a majority. Ms Sturgeon was asked on BBC2's Newsnight whether her party would be ready to prop up a Labour government if the party had fewer seats than the Conservatives. She replied: ' Yes. Even if the Tories are the largest party, if there is an anti Tory majority, my offer to Labour is to work together to keep the Tories out.' Asked if this would remain her position even if Mr Cameron had 30 more MPs than Mr Miliband, she confirmed: ' If there is an anti Tory majority, yes, that's what I've been saying all along - I'm not sure why there's any confusion about it - that we would work with Labour to stop the Tories getting into Downing Street.' And if the margin was as wide as 40 MPs, she said: ' If they can't command a majority they can't be a government, that's the basic rule of how governments are formed I'd have thought.' The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - campaigning in Glasgow today - said she would help make Ed Miliband Prime Minister even if Labour finish 40 seats behind the Tories . Ms Sturgeon was pictured with three-year-old Kitty MacDonald and SNP Candidate for Glasgow South Stewart McDonald during a visit to Glazed, a ceramic painting studio in the city . Ms Sturgeon also rejected an independent study which said there was a 'significant disconnect' between the SNP's claims to be an anti-austerity party and plans that implied it would be spending less than Labour by 2019/20. The Institute for Fiscal Studies accused  the major parties of keeping voters 'in the dark' by spelling out only the 'broad outlines' of their tax and spend plans following the May 7 poll, though it  singled out the Liberal Democrats for being more transparent than their rivals about their intentions. Ed Miliband, pictured in Chatham House, central London today, could become Prime Minister even if he wins fewer votes and MPs than David Cameron . The thinktank's deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice.' Conservatives say they would eliminate the deficit by 2017/18 and start to run a surplus while Labour says it will reduce the deficit each year and balance the books 'as soon as possible' during the five-year term. The IFS said the Tory plans were 'predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases', and could involve 'further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £30 billion'. Labour's plans were consistent with a pledge not to borrow for day-to-day spending but 'would leave borrowing at £26 billion a year in today's terms', it said. The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. While the SNP would 'cut less to start with', the implication of the plans spelt out in their manifesto would be that the 'period of austerity would be longer than under the other three parties we consider', it said. Responding to the comments, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said Ms Sturgeon was going to 'ignore the will of the people', if she chose to support the smaller of the two main parties at Westminster. He added: 'She's going to ignore how people vote and she's just going to insist on her personal preference.' She told the BBC's Newsnight that 'if [the Conservatives] can't command a majority, they can't be a government'. Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly said she would work with Labour to 'get rid of the Tories' if the SNP had enough MPs. The Prime Minister, speaking in Lincoln with the Foreign Secretary William Hague, has called that prospect on an SNP-Labour alliance 'frightening' and claimed it would lead to 'economic ruin' Conservative leader David Cameron has called that prospect 'frightening' and said it would lead to 'economic ruin'. While the SNP had only six MPs at Westminster in the last Parliament, recent polls suggest they could win the majority of Scotland's 59 seats. That could leave the party holding the balance of power if the election resulted in a hung parliament.","SNP leader vowed to prop up Labour even if the Tories finish clear winners .

There's something effortless about a wide leg trouser that really appeals. And if like us you are growing tired of the skinny jean and want to try out a new look this could be your answer. Louise Redknapp says that a wide-leg trouser can come as a welcome relief from the skinny jean . Skinny jeans have held court for quite a few years now and while they will never go out of style the wide leg will give you an alternative look.

The wide leg can be intimidating, especially if you're on the shorter side. But the key is all in the shoe. Huge amounts of fabric is hard to look flattering but if you keep your heels high and your top half simple you can pull it off with confidence. A high heeled shoe with an exposed top of foot will elongate the leg, a must when wearing a cropped voluminous trouser. Louise and Emma say to avoid being drowned by too much fabric try a high heeled shoe . Louise recommends pairing a wide-leg with a simple knit to keep the outfit in proportion . If going for a longer length go high-waisted and very long to give extra leg length. Proportion is everything, team with a simple knit, shirt or tee to keep the look current and cool, not costume. Denim is the easiest way to nail the trend - Gucci revisited the Seventies with a collection filled with flared jeans in vintage washes. The stylish pair agree that denim is the easiest way to achieve the trend . The wide-leg trouser made an appearance on several catwalks including on the runway of Gucci SS15 who showcased a denim take on the trend, for a high street take try the Topshop Miller jean (right) Celine showcased colourful billowing bottoms on their SS15 runway . Topshop meanwhile have been quick to follow suit with their version - the Miller - a 1970s-style wide leg flare.

Hazard tucked home a penalty to put Chelsea in front before Charlie Adam scored a memorable 66-yard equaliser for the visitors. But Loic Remy was on hand to turn home Hazard's square pass to wrap up the three points and take Chelsea seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. Chelsea captain John Terry hailed Eden Hazard as one of the world's best players following the Stoke win . The Belgian international gave Chelsea the lead from the spot and made no mistake against Asmir Begovic . Hazard jumps in the air to celebrate his goal during the hard-fought win over Stoke City in west London . And, in a game where Diego Costa lasted just 10 minutes having been introduced from the bench before being forced off with a hamstring injury, Hazard was the man to make the difference with Terry quick to praise him. 'He was excellent,' Terry told Sky Sports 1. 'He has been our best player by a long way this year and in those games when you are looking for a bit of extra, a bit of magic from someone he is the one who steps up and managed to create something. He is up there with the (Lionel) Messi's and (Cristiano) Ronaldo's and can still get better and better.'

Diego Costa looks set to miss at least two weeks after suffering a hamstring injury during the match . Costa had only been on the field just over ten minutes before he pulled up with the muscle injury . Jose Mourinho expects the striker to be out for at least two Premier League games following the injury . 'It was a tough game, we knew it was going to be difficult,' he added.

8041,"Perched on a hotel sofa barely inches from Glynis Barber, I am trying, as covertly as possible, to scrutinise her rather lovely face. All peachy skin and thick, glossy locks, she also looks trim and toned in skinny jeans. It’s difficult to believe that in the next few months, the actress – remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of ITV’s 1980s detective duo Dempsey And Makepeace – will be collecting her bus pass. From where I’m sitting, she looks barely a day over 40. It is impossible, frankly, not to wonder whether Mother Nature has been given a, shall we say, little helping hand. There is no ‘pillow face’ here or unnaturally shaped eyebrows (a telltale sign). So has she and would she? Scroll down for video . Then and now: Tearing up the rulebook: Glynis Barber, pictured left in 1984, and right, the actress today . Glynis Barber, pictured at The Olivier Awards at The Royal Opera House in London last week . It’s a question that Glynis answers diplomatically. ‘I am a bit surgery-phobic – I am a total coward,’ she insists. ‘I don’t judge anyone for doing it – people have to do what’s right for them. But for me a healthy lifestyle is the key.’ It’s hard to argue with that sentiment. And this, indeed, is why we are meeting. For the past two years, under the tutelage of nutritional therapist Fleur Borrelli, Glynis has changed what and how she eats – and in the process, she says, transformed her health and her figure. She tore up her rulebook too: out went breakfast – instead she has just two large meals a day. Out, too, went wholegrains and she even stopped sipping water in the day, something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger. So convinced is she that what Fleur taught her is the key to long-lasting health and wellbeing that she has co-written a book with her, The In-Sync Diet, in which she shares their discoveries, backed up, she says, by credible new research. ‘I had no idea that when I met Fleur I would drop a stone in weight and a dress size, gain lean muscle, and have vastly improved energy levels, all while turning upside down the things I previously believed in,’ Glynis says. ‘But that’s what has happened and it’s why I wanted to share it with a wider audience.’ The actress (pictured with co-star Michael Brandon) is remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of ITV’s 1980s detective duo Dempsey And Makepeace . Ironically, Glynis once thought herself the last person to need a lifestyle reboot. Always fit, she went organic in her late 20s at a time when it was barely heard of. ‘This was the 1980s so everyone thought I was mad, although it made complete sense to me,’ she recalls. ‘My view was it was silly to put chemicals in your body that don’t need to be there, but that was forward-thinking at the time. It was me, Prince Charles and some hippies. But I stuck to it.’ Glynis, married to her Dempsey And Makepeace co-star Michael Brandon, has enjoyed a busy career in theatre and TV, but two years ago started to develop unexplained joint pain and was advised by her osteopath to see Fleur. ‘I was actually pretty resistant at first as I thought the one thing I know is how to eat properly,’ she explains. But Fleur thought differently. ‘One by one she busted a lot of the myths that were a cornerstone of my diet.’ First to face scrutiny was Glynis’s fondness for wholegrains. ‘I was surprised as I knew about processed grains but I thought wholewheat was fine, until Fleur explained that it creates inflammation in the gut. She told me to cut them out.’ Aging well: Glynis, pictured left in her 30s, will be celebrate turning 60 soon, but she looks barely a day over 40 . It meant a gluten-free diet – not easy for a self-confessed ‘breadaholic’. Pasta was also jettisoned, replaced by protein and vegetables. ‘At first I thought, “I can’t do this,” ’ she explains. ‘But now I don’t miss them at all. I eat salmon, eggs, nuts, organic turkey and salads.’ And it was not just what she ate but when that Fleur also changed. Glynis ate little and often in the belief it kept her blood sugar levels regulated. But Fleur told her that cutting out breakfast altogether and eating two large meals a day was a better way of regulating her metabolism. This is backed up by new research into intermittent fasting, which shows that better weight control can be achieved with long periods without eating – popularised by the 5:2 diets, in which you consume very few calories for two days of the week and eat a normal, balanced diet the rest of the time. Some studies have found the same benefits – which also include lower cholesterol and blood pressure – might be gained by daily ‘fasts’ achieved by eating dinner then nothing else until lunch the next day. Then came what Glynis drank. ‘I was one of those people who walked around clutching a water bottle and sipping at it throughout the day,’ she says. ‘But new research shows that drinking little and often actually doesn’t help the cells replenish properly. It’s far better to drink a large glass of water when you’re thirsty.’ Glynis tore up her rulebook too: out went breakfast and she even stopped sipping water in the day, something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger . Initially cynical, Glynis says she was amazed by how easy it was to adapt. ‘What I was trying to overturn were the habits of a lifetime and I thought it would be incredibly hard, but it honestly took a matter of weeks. It’s not set in stone either. If I want the odd blowout, or I really fancy breakfast, then I have it.’ Aided by her regular cardio and hot yoga sessions, she believes she is in better shape than she was 20 years ago. ‘I have always been fit but I used to get incredibly tired. Now I am bursting with energy.’ And, Glynis insists, she is less likely to scrutinise herself. ‘I actually feel less vain now than I did in my youth. I’m very comfortable in my skin and I’m really not hung up on age at all. You can’t do anything about your chronological age, but how you age is up to you.’ The In-Sync Diet, by Glynis Barber and Fleur Borrelli, is published by Autharium on Friday. The actress follows a gluten-free diet, with food like pasta jettisoned, replaced by protein and vegetables . Why hydration is key . By Barney Calman, Health Editor . We should all drink at least two litres of water a day – about eight glasses. If we do, we’ll be slimmer, have better skin, fewer health problems and the like. Right? Well, no, actually. The whole two-litres-a-day idea is based on no real scientific evidence. In fact, one of the only studies to suggest its benefits was sponsored by, you’ve guessed it, a mineral water firm. Dehydration can be fatal, and in the case of the elderly, sick children or those with other health problems, a watchful eye should be kept on water intake. But in normal, healthy adults, the body is well adapted to make sure this doesn’t happen. If you drink too little, you get thirsty, and go to the loo less. If you drink a lot, you generally pee it all out. And in fact, the best way to make sure is to check the colour of your urine. Ideally, it should be a shade of pale straw and no darker.","Glynis Barber is known as beautiful half of ITV’s 1980s detective duo .

6739,"(CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin shrugged off repeated questions about the impact of Western sanctions on his nation during a nationally broadcast annual Q&A session. ""Sanctions are sanctions,"" he said. ""As far as sanctions are concerned .... (they're) about the need to constrain our development,"" not just about Ukraine and Crimea. Western sanctions were implemented after Moscow annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists battled Ukrainian government forces in the nation's east. Putin predicted the sanctions would not end soon. On the Middle East, the Russian leader defended lifting a ban on the sale of a sophisticated air defense system to Iran. ""We need to encourage our Iranian partners,"" Putin said, referring to a preliminary deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Sanctions against Iran have had a dramatic impact on the nation's economy. On Israeli and Western fears that such a system would embolden Iran, Putin scoffed. ""Iran is not a threat to Israel at all,"" he said. ""It is a defense weapon."" Putin's annual exercise is fascinating for ordinary Russians, who normally get him in closely managed doses on state-run television. These sessions are live and can go on and on. Last year, he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes. In 2013, it was a record-setting four hours and 47 minutes. Organizers said public interest was especially strong this year, with 2.4 million questions submitted. Of course, critics of the Kremlin slam the entire event as Russia's imitation of democracy in action. It's hard to imagine a truly critical question, they say, getting aired on national television there. In fact, it's best not to look at this event as an opportunity for Russians to question their leader at all. Instead, it is more like a highly produced, highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them, and to the world. Last year, there was a ""surprise"" appearance by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia. He addressed Putin by video link, quizzing Putin about Moscow's own surveillance practices.","Putin has spent hours fielding questions from the general public on live television .

10642,"Two Maryland parents whose hands-off 'free-range' parenting got their children picked up by police yet again on Sunday are now vowing to file a lawsuit. Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their son Rafi, 10, and daughter Dvora, 6, roam free in their suburban neighborhood. But the Meitivs, both of them scientists, say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up Rafi and Dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents. Picked up: Officials seized Dvora, 6, (far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. The parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv (right) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours . Attorney Matthew Dowd, of the firm Wiley Rein, is representing the Meitivs and on Tuesday sent a ointed letter regarding Sunday's events. Rein wrote: . 'The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. 'This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent’s reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children.' The firm declined to say who the suit would be against, exactly, when asked by the Washington Post. However, the attorney has vowed to pursue 'all legal remedies' to protect the rights of the Maryland parents. The Meitivs made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi and Dvora walking the sidewalk on their own. Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. ‘They kept the kids for hours,’ a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. ‘It’s 10:30 at night. They’ve been missing since 6 o’clock…Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn’t call us.’ According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . ‘The policeman said “We’ll give you a ride home” when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said “I’ll bring you home” and, instead, he brought us here.’ 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . ‘They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I’m not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.","Police seized Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6, in a Maryland park on Sunday and their parents say they weren't reunited by CPS for hours .

The 28-year-old flame-haired beauty recently spent a stint on the stage, starring in a West End production of David Mamet’s Speed The Plow - for which she received lukewarm reviews - and seems intent on remaining in the UK for the foreseeable future. ‘[London] feels like home, I miss it every time I have to leave for work and can’t wait to get back,’ Lindsay told Homme Style Magazine while posing for a stunning and seductive shoot for the publication. ‘I go back to NYC and LA for family and work.’ Scroll down for video .

We haven't heard much from Lindsay in the US since she moved across the pond to London. But if her latest photo shoot for Homme Style magazine is any indication, she's making a comeback in a major way. The Mean Girls star showed of her svelte figure in a series of racy ensembles by Moschino and Agent Provacateur. Here she poses wearing nothing but a Fleur Du Mal leather corset, La Perla panties, and a pair of Moschino gloves. Corsets were hot on the Spring runways at Givenchy and Versace and continue to be a wardrobe staple for sultry celebs like Madonna and Kim Kardashian. Lindsay's leather number is available to purchase for just under $1,000. That's quite a big budget for lingerie, so we've come up with some alternatives that are less pricey but still have major sex appeal.

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same ""situations"" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'","Lindsay, 28, moved to the UK last spring before making her London stage debut .

9704,"Any defender who saw Jack Grealish glide around the Wembley turf with composure beyond his years should think twice before deciding that kicking him off the pitch is the way to limit his effectiveness. Between the ages of 10 and 14, Grealish played Gaelic football to a high standard, even appearing at Croke Park five years ago in a match during half-time of a Dublin v Kerry senior game. On his debut for John Mitchels, a GAA club in Warwickshire, he received a mighty blow and appealed to the referee. ‘This isn’t soccer, Jack,’ he was told without pity.

Grealish celebrates with Fabian Delph (left) and Gabby Agbonlahor (centre) in the Wembley dressing room . After progressing through the Villa youth ranks he had to give up the sport where opponents would kick him and stamp on his fingers, but the toughness remains. The 19-year-old was clobbered by two fouls against Liverpool in Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final win, picking himself up each time. He wears his socks rolled down to show he is unafraid of taking ferocious hits. As a 15-year-old he watched a Sky Sports special dedicated to George Best and saw the Manchester United great dribble through a forest of tackles to score. Best wore his socks round his ankles in defiance, and Grealish decided to do the same. Now there is an aspect of superstition to the practice although he does buy kid-sized shinpads to meet safety regulations. Grealish wears his socks around his ankles but has to buy kid-sized shinpads to meet safety regulations . Man United legend George Best also wore his socks round his ankles with Grealish deciding to do the same . ‘It’s just his style,’ said Villa manager Tim Sherwood. ‘If he performs how I think he can, he can dress how he wants. It’s not a fashion show. He is good and perhaps he knows he’s good. You know what he said to me when I told him he was playing? He just said: “Bout time!”’ Grealish, on Chelsea’s radar until agreeing a new deal earlier this season, recorded Sunday’s game and celebrated Villa’s win by going home to watch it twice more. He is refreshingly down-to-earth. This evening Grealish will attend his nephew’s school cup final and present an award, bringing a pair of signed boots, too.

Grealish and his Aston Villa team-mates celebrate as the club reached their first FA Cup final since 2000 . Grealish may draw a larger crowd after Sunday’s memorable Wembley debut in which he played a role in both Villa goals. There was also a breathtaking moment when he controlled a dropping ball, killing it dead with one touch. It showed why there is an international tussle between England and Ireland for his services. Watching proudly were dad Kevin, mum Karen, brother Kevan, and model girlfriend Sasha Attwood. They have been together since they were 14.

But had Nottingham Forest not been under a transfer embargo on deadline day in February, this would be a different tale. Left out of squads by former boss Paul Lambert, Grealish was looking to go out on loan to continue his development. The Forest deal was in place but fell through. When Sherwood arrived things began to change. Grealish was selected for the huge relegation clash with Queens Park Rangers, and again at Tottenham.

When he did that during a loan spell at Notts County last season — five times to help them avoid relegation to League Two — he looked to the skies with emotion. He lost baby brother Keelan to cot death 15 years ago this month. He also has two younger sisters, Keira and Hollie. Hollie has cerebral palsy and after the win at Tottenham, Grealish gave his shirt to a supporter he saw in a wheelchair.

2242,"Nick Clegg has been accused of blaming 'everyone but himself' after making a series of excuses for the party's disastrous poll ratings. In an interview, the Lib Dem leader listed a range of reasons why different groups of former supporters are 'p***** off' and have deserted the party since 2010. And he said all those reasons were more important than any policy decisions he made including on tuition fees. Scroll down for video . Collapse: Nick Clegg has told the Economist there was a range of reasons why different groups left. Pictures: The Lib Dem leader on the campaign trail in north west England on Tuesday, April 7 . Blame game: But Mr Clegg has said none of them were to do with his policy making decisions . He was asked in an interview with the Economist magazine why Lib Dem support had 'collapsed' in the last five years. He blamed protest voters who supported the party but deserted it after it entered coalition because they didn't want to take any 'responsibility'. He also blamed the fact the Lib Dems had entered into coalition with one of the major parties. He said going in with Tories meant it was 'inevitable' that support would fall in 'anti-conservative' parts of Britain. And he said public sector workers had left because their pensions were hit and some faced job cuts. Mr Clegg said there was 'clearly a section of the support we had in 2010 that was virulently anti-Conservative'. Coallition: Mr Clegg said going in with the Tories meant they would lose 'virulently anti-Conservative' voters . Cuts: Public sector workers had left because their pensions were hit and some faced job cuts, he claimed . He said: 'They're the ones who still scream and shout blue murder and have done so without pause for breath for half a decade. And they're loud and they're noisy and they're angry. 'And that was a significant chunk of support that basically wanted to be associated with any party that didn't have the remotest sniff of power. 'There just is a constituency out there that wants to be entirely bereft of any responsibility. So they're clearly also very pissed off. It was 'wholly predictable and totally unsurprising' that public sector workers were at risk of being 'disenchanted'. He added that those factors are 'probably more important explanations than tuition fees, or this decision or that decision, although those obviously play a part'. Mr Clegg said some areas of country are a Lib Dem 'desert' and the party is now running a 'defensive' campaign focusing on winning where it retains support. 'Petulant': A Tory source has told the Daily Mail: 'This sums Nick Clegg. Its everyone's fault but his own' He admitted there are 'great parts of the country now where there is just no Liberal Democrat presence' citing the North of England and areas where they are fighting against Labour. He added: 'We're not going to waste any time, any effort, any money, any energy on places where we're not going to win—which, by the way, is the vast majority of the country.' In 2010 the Lib Dems won 23 per cent of the vote but national polls in recent months have put them on single digits. A Tory source said: 'This sums Nick Clegg. Its everyone's fault but his own. He is like a petulant child.' Despite his party facing the prospect of losing dozens of seats, Mr Clegg used the interview to stake a claim for a particular government department his party would like to run if he is back in coalition after May 7. He said he would call for the Lib Dems to be given control of education, and criticised the 'fruitless and fruitcakey' policy 'spasms' under former Education Secretary Michael Gove.","Nick Clegg lists why Lib Dem support 'collapsed' in Economist interview .

970,"Jurors have started deliberations in the case against a man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, whose 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Etan Patz 'is larger than his very little, important life,' Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in closing arguments at the Manhattan murder trial of Pedro Hernandez. She asked jurors to convict Hernandez of murder, saying he was a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it. Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez . Pedro Hernandez, left, is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, right, who vanished in 1979 . Hernandez confessed in 2012 in a case that has confounded law enforcement for decades. Etan's body was never found, nor was any trace of clothing or his belongings. He had never been considered a suspect - his name appears only once in law enforcement paperwork at the time Etan disappeared. The defense says the admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ. A teenage stock clerk at the corner shop, Hernandez knew there were children in and out of the store, and Etan had been there countless times, the prosecutor said. She said Hernandez saw Etan with a dollar and calculated he wanted a drink, so he asked him to the basement. 'Day after day he saw this beautiful little boy,' she said. 'One day, he acted on an impulse and did something terrible to this little boy.' She said the motive was sexual, and Etan likely fought back. 'The quickest and easiest way to shut him up and shut him up permanently was to choke him to death,' she said. Rosemary Hernandez, left, and Becky Hernandez, the wife and daughter of Pedro Hernandez, arrive for court in New York, on Wednesday . Stanley Patz, left, the father of Etan Patz, arrives for court on Wednesday, although his estranged wife Julie, right, hasn't been pictured at court in recent days . Illuzzi-Orbon said his first confession to a prayer group shortly after the boy disappeared was the most accurate - he was confessing to God, and he was trying to unburden himself. Prayer circle members testified that Hernandez made tearful admissions during a 1979 retreat that matched some of what he told authorities on video 33 years later: He gave a child a soda, took him to the store basement and choked him. Two said Hernandez also admitted abusing the boy; when talking to police, Hernandez denied molesting Etan. A former neighbor and his ex-wife also testified he told them about killing someone in New York. The Maple Shade, New Jersey, man made the stunning admissions to police after authorities received a tip from a relative who saw news reports of the case in 2012. Site: Hernandez was working in 1979 at this corner convenience store, near where Etan was last seen where the man said he threw the boy's body into trash . 'I grabbed him by the neck and started choking him,' said Hernandez, now 54. 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me.' Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said the confession video shows 'a man sitting there convinced he killed a child - on a day that he doesn't know, at a time he doesn't know, at a location near a bus stop that he doesn't know.' The defense has suggested that the real killer is a convicted pedophile jailed in Pennsylvania who was the longtime suspect in the case. That man, Jose Ramos, denies involvement. However, a former federal prosecutor and FBI agent testified that Ramos told investigators he was '90 percent' sure a boy he took from a park was Etan, and Hernandez's former prison cellmate testified that Ramos admitted molesting the boy. 'Two confessions,' Fishbein said. 'Which person is more likely to have been a predator?' Etan's photo was one of the first on milk cartons. The day he went missing, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day.

5220,"Sir James Munby says parents should use the 'carrot and the stick' approach to getting their children to do things they don't want to do . The job of parents is to make their children do the things they do not want to do, the country’s most senior family law judge said yesterday. Mothers and fathers should use the ‘carrot and the stick’ approach to make children do the things they find boring or difficult – from going to the dentist to doing their homework, Sir James Munby said. He suggested confiscating mobiles and electronic gadgets, grounding teenagers, and ‘threats falling short of brute force’ as suitable methods for parents to get their way. The price of failure, the judge suggested, could be lifelong pain for the parents or even, if the children’s education or health was at stake, their removal by social workers to grow up in state care. Sir James, who is President of the Family Division, gave his advice in a case in which two teenage girls have refused to see their father for more than six years. Sir James, sitting in the Appeal Court with Lady Justice Black and Lord Justice Vos, said there would be no winners if the girls, aged 14 and 16, were not persuaded to restore their relationship with their father. Sir James said being a parent was tough. But he added: ‘That is what parenting is all about. ‘There are many things which they ought to do that children may not want to do or even refuse to do: going to the dentist, going to visit some “boring” elderly relative, going to school, doing homework or sitting an examination, the list is endless. ‘The parents’ job, exercising all their parental skills, techniques and stratagems – which may include use of both the carrot and the stick and, in the case of the older child, reason and argument, is to get the child to do what it does not want to do.’ Sir James said dealing with strong-willed teenagers could be taxing and demanding. Being a parent is tough, Sir James said - but he added: 'That is what parenting is all about'. (Stock image) ‘But parental responsibility does not shrivel away, merely because the child is 14 or even 16,’ he said, ‘nor does the parental obligation to take all reasonable steps to ensure that a child of that age does what it ought to be doing, and does not do what it ought not to be doing. ‘What one can reasonably demand, not merely as a matter of law but also and much more fundamentally as a matter of natural parental obligation, is that the parent, by argument, persuasion, cajolement, blandishments, inducements, sanctions – for example, “grounding” or the confiscation of mobile phones, computers or other electronic equipment – or threats falling short of brute force, or by a combination of them, does their level best to ensure compliance.’ He added: ‘That is what one would expect of a parent whose rebellious teenage child is foolishly refusing to do GCSEs or A-levels or “dropping out” into a life of drug-fuelled crime. ‘Why should we expect any less of a parent whose rebellious teenage child is refusing to see her father?’ Confiscating mobile phones or gadgets from teenagers is a suitable way for parents to get their way, said judge Sir James Munby . The estrangement of the girls from their father began in 2008 when on a weekend visit the father’s new wife grabbed and pushed one of them during a row. The mother asked for contact with the father to be stopped. Sir James said of the parents: ‘Unless they can, as they must, even at this late stage, sort things out, the future for all of them is bleak. There will be no winners here; all will be losers.’ The girls had a distorted and damaging opinion of their father, he added. However, he said, sooner or later the teenagers would discover the truth. ‘What will the children think, how will they react, when they discover, as one day they will, that their father is not the man they currently believe him to be?’ he asked. ‘Will they then turn against their mother? Will they reject both parents? The mother needs to ponder these questions and think hard about what the answers might be.’ Nevertheless, the judges rejected the father’s appeal against an earlier court ruling which said he had no right to contact with the girls. But despite what the ruling says, the court called on the mother to take it upon herself to rebuild family ties.","Sir James Munby made comments during ruling over family dispute .

8923,"In a quest to be more green, Apple says it is investing in Chinese solar power and preserving American forests that make environmentally friendly paper. The tech giant announced a new focus on using paper from trees harvested under environmentally sound conditions. As part of the deal, Apple has pledged an unspecified amount of money for a Virginia-based nonprofit, the Conservation Fund, to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the East Coast. Then EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, now Apple's president for environmental initiatives, has spearheaded the new green focus at the world's biggest company. Apple pledged an unspecified amount of money for a Virginia-based nonprofit, the Conservation Fund, to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the East Coast. In the Reed Forest of Aroostook County, Maine, wetlands, rivers, and upland forest provide refuge for Atlantic salmon, bald eagle, and Canada lynx. In Brunswick Forest located in southern North Carolina, the high-quality pine savannas and unique plants and flowers have long made this land a conservation priority. The Conservation Fund will resell the land to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees. The initiatives come as the tech giant this year met a self-imposed goal of powering all its U.S. operations with renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions — initiatives that have won high marks from environmental groups. On Thursday,  It's also promising to use more renewable power overseas, where Apple relies heavily on contract manufacturers — and where a top executive acknowledged the company can do more. 'It's important to us to tackle climate change everywhere we are,' Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president for environmental initiatives, told The Associated Press. 'When you talk about China, you're talking about manufacturing partners. 'We're looking to bring the same innovation there. 'This is the start.' The new solar project in China has a capacity of 40 megawatts, which is smaller than some projects Apple has announced in the United States. By comparison, Apple is spending $850 million for rights to nearly half the output of a 280-megawatt solar facility planned for construction south of Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. That project will produce enough energy to power all of Apple's California offices, a computer center and 52 retail stores. Still, the Chinese project will produce more than the amount of energy consumed by Apple's 19 corporate offices and 21 retail stores in China and Hong Kong, Jackson said. She added that Apple uses renewable energy for 87 percent of the power at its facilities worldwide. That figure, however, doesn't include substantial power consumption by contract manufacturers. With the new project in China, Apple is looking to improve its own operations first. 'Before we go somewhere else and start asking and eventually requiring clean energy, you want to make sure you show folks how to do it,' said Jackson, who was U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator during President Barack Obama's first term. Apple and other tech companies have drawn criticism in the past for use of toxics in manufacturing and data centers powered by electricity from coal. But Apple's moves away from those practices in recent years have won accolades from groups like Greenpeace, which issued a statement praising the Chinese project Thursday. Jackson declined to say how much Apple is investing in the Chinese project, which is being built in partnership with U.S. energy company SunPower and four Chinese firms. Although China is known for heavy reliance on coal, its government has set aggressive goals for solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Meanwhile, Apple pledged an unspecified amount of money for a Virginia-based nonprofit, the Conservation Fund, to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the East Coast. The Conservation Fund will resell the land — 36,000 acres of timberland in Maine and North Carolina — to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees. Larry Selzer, the group's chief executive, said that will protect the forest while keeping it in the hands of private owners who pay taxes and create jobs. The Conservation Fund will resell the land — 36,000 acres of timberland in Maine and North Carolina — to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees. Selzer said he'll use proceeds from reselling the land to buy and protect additional tracts. 'Apple believes that paper, like energy, can be a renewable resource,' the pair said in a blog post announceing the deal. 'So Apple is striving to supply 100 percent of the virgin fibers used in its paper and packaging from sustainably managed forests or controlled wood sources. ' Apple won't necessarily buy paper made from trees on that land, but Jackson said the investment will increase the supply of sustainable wood fiber. She said the two tracts would produce about half the non-recycled wood fiber used in Apple's product packaging last year. That would put Apple halfway toward its goal of obtaining all its non-recycled paper products from sustainable timber. Apple wouldn't say how much paper it uses, but it says two-thirds of its paper packaging comes from recycled material. In the last three months of 2014, Apple sold more than 100 million iPhones and other gadgets, most in cardboard boxes.

9324,"Real Madrid's last win against Atletico Madrid came in the Champions League final less than a year ago, but in the time since that memorable night in Lisbon Carlo Ancelotti's side have failed to win any of their last seven games against their city rivals. Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final second leg will be the eighth time the two teams have met since last season's final, with Diego Simeone's men emerging victorious on four occasions over the previous eight months. Real needed a late equaliser from Sergio Ramos and extra-time to beat Atleti at Benfica's Estadio da Luz in May last year but Los Rojiblancos have gained a measure of revenge since. Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't find the back of the net as Real Madrid drew 0-0 with Atletico Madrid last week . Gareth Bale scores in extra-time during Real's Champions League final win against Atletico last season . Real Madrid have not beaten rivals Atletico since victory in Lisbon, losing four games and drawing three . Real Madrid wins - 0 . Atletico Madrid wins - 4 . Draws - 3 . Real Madrid goals - 4 . Atletico Madrid goals - 12 . Atletico's dominance began with victory in the Spanish Super Cup, a two-legged tie played between the winners of La Liga and the Copa del Rey. A late equaliser from Raul Garcia cancelled out James Rodriguez's opener at the Bernabeu before Mario Manduzkic netted the only goal of the game at the Vicente Calderon to seal a 2-1 win on aggregate. Less than a month later and Simeone's men were at it again, this time defeating Los Blancos in their own backyard in La Liga. A penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo got the hosts level after Tiago's early header but Arda Turan popped up in the 76th minute to sweep the ball past Iker Casillas and secure a 2-1 triumph. Atletico's third win against Real this season arrived in January when the two sides met in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey. With the first leg on home soil, Fernando Torres made a winning return to his boyhood club as he helped the hosts earn a 2-0 win courtesy of goals from Garcia and Jose Maria Gimenez.

Fernando Torres scores his second goal during Atletico's 2-2 draw with Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey . Atleti finished the job at the Bernabeu with goals in the first minute of each half from Torres helping them to a 2-2 draw on the night and 4-2 victory on aggregate. Real's most humiliating result in their seven-game winless streak arrived at the Vicente Calderon on February 7 as Gareth Bale and Co suffered their heaviest defeat in over four years. Goals from Tiago, Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann and Mandzukic earned the reigning champions a 4-0 win to maintain their hopes of a second consecutive title. The two sides played out a goalless draw in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final last week, with Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak widely praised for denying Real a crucial away goal.

9140,"Ironing may be the Marmite of household chores. But, love it or loathe it, unless you want to look like you’ve slept on a park bench, you can’t avoid it. British company Swan, which sold its first iron in 1933, has just released a top-of-the-range steam generator iron, for £279.99. But does it really make things easier? Tessa Cunningham finds out. SUPER STEAMER . Swan SI9031N Steam Generator Iron, £279.99, swan-brand.co.uk . If you loathe ironing enough to splash out almost £300, then Swan’s luxury model could be the one for you. It cut my ironing time by half. It’s usually my least favouite chore, but when testing this one, I got to work in front of Poldark and was done within 20 minutes. Because all the water is in the separate 1,000ml generator tank, the iron itself is lightweight. The steam is forced out of the generator through a hose into the iron, shooting out at 90g per minute — twice as fast as conventional steam irons (think of the difference in power between jet-washing and using a hosepipe) — cutting through creases quicker. As well as being more powerful, it also produces twice as much steam, making shorter work of wrinkles. On the downside, despite the investment, you get only a two-year guarantee. 3/5 . PRECISION PERFECT . Philips Easy Speed Plus, £29.50, amazon.co.uk . The big selling point of this pretty aqua blue iron is the precision tip, which means you can get really sharp creases flat with minimum elbow grease, making it perfect for shirts and trousers. I also love the vertical steam option, which means you can smooth creases from hanging fabrics, such as curtains, by holding the iron vertically 2 in away and pressing the steam button. Steam output is 35g per minute — with a boost function of up to 120g to blast at stubborn creases. Impressive for the price. 4/5 . BARGAIN BUY . Swan Steam Iron SI1001ON, £19.99, argos.co.uk . This does an adequate job and you get a lot for your money — including a generous 350ml water tank and variable steam control, which means you can opt for continuous steam at 40g per min or a 140g per minute shot of steam. But it’s so heavy, at 1.3kg, that I’m in danger of developing muscles like Popeye if I keep using it. And while the dolphin-shaped nose helps me reach tricky areas, such as around shirt buttons, it makes the iron look downright ugly. I also found the soleplate scaled up quickly. 2/5 . POWER HOUSE . Braun TexStyle 7 TS755, £49.99, johnlewis.com . This looks like a fighter jet, and is so heavy (1.3kg empty and 1.65kg when the water tank is full) it makes ironing even more of an effort. On the plus side, the ergonomic handle is easy to hold. I also like the way the cable is 2.5m long — useful if you can’t get near a plug. It’s impressively powerful. Steam shoots out at 50g per minute and the precision shot also releases steam at 170g per minute. 3/5 . LIGHTWEIGHT PRO . Russell Hobbs Autosteam Pro Iron, £19.99, argos.co.uk . One of the cheapest irons I tried, this is beautifully lightweight at 1.14kg despite having a large 320ml water tank. There are lots of functions such as a non-stick soleplate and a vertical steam option. You also get a generous two-metre cord. But it falls down on the one job I’m paying for — ironing. Although it is supposed to be non-drip, it leaked at low temperatures and left unsightly marks on my silk shirt. 2/5 . VALUE FOR MONEY . Philips PerfectCare Pure Steam Generator, £119.99, robertdyas.co.uk . The nearest rival to the Swan iron and less than half the price, this is fantastic value for a top-range model bursting with extras. I normally dread ironing my grandmother’s thick linen table cloth, but I removed every crease in seconds with no effort. It’s all thanks to the impressive 1.5-litre water reservoir which pumps out high-pressure steam at 110g per minute. And the soleplate is designed so steam is distributed evenly — meaning fewer strokes and speedy ironing. The manufacturer boasts that you never need to change the settings as it creates the perfect temperature level whether you are ironing silk PJs or kids’ jeans. I tried it — and it was true. You also get a five-year guarantee. 5/5 . CORDLESS POWER . Tefal Freemove FV9970, £79.99, johnlewis.com . Tefal is hugely proud of its cordless iron. And with good reason. The base recharges the iron during each rest period, which means there is no cord getting in your way, and the control panel lets you know when you need to recharge. It’s powerful, too — delivering an impressive 180g per minute shot of steam. The handy steam on-demand trigger got rid of stubborn creases in my partner’s shirts. It also has a vertical steam option. I used it to blast away creases in a dress that had been hanging in my wardrobe for too long — much easier than dragging out the ironing board. If you’re happy to pay over the odds to dispense with a cord, this is a great option. 3/5 . TURBO STEAM . Tefal Ultimate Anti-Calc FV9603, £69.99, argos.co.uk . Lots of impressive features here — such as a unit which collects all the limescale from your iron. A turbo steam function delivers a mighty 200g per minute jet of steam and an anti-drip mechanism cuts down on the chances of water leaking. But this iron is too darn heavy: a stonking 1.5kg when empty; once the 350ml tank is full, it’s like lifting a brick. On the plus side, it provides the perfect excuse to hand over the ironing to my partner. 3/5 .","British company Swan has unveiled a new £279.99 super steam iron .

10415,"(CNN)A Florida judge denied a motion by two women to join a lawsuit against Prince Andrew and a prominent U.S. lawyer that alleged  underage sex crimes. Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- ""Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4"" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the ""lurid details"" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. ""The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken."" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: ""I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them."" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. ""He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,"" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that ""Doe 3"" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a ""sex slave"" and made ""her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people."" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, ""Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case ""is all about money"" and ""completely made up."" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said ""lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably."" ""Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,"" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. ""Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,"" he stated, ""that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.""

7478,"The panel that cleared Inverness defender Josh Meekings to play in the William Hill Scottish Cup final did not even consider his handball, the Scottish Football Association has revealed. Meekings saw his cup-final ban thrown out by a judicial panel tribunal on Thursday after Caley Thistle challenged his one-game suspension for denying Celtic an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberate handball. And it has emerged the Highland club's lawyers successfully argued that SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan had no right to bring the case because match officials had seen the incident where Meekings stopped a Leigh Griffiths header during his side's 3-2 win over Celtic on Sunday. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . The SFA published the reasons given by the chair of the three-man panel. They read: 'Further to the judicial panel hearing yesterday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings' solicitor. 'In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. 'The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned before the verdict that the SFA was veering into dangerous territory . 'It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.' The decision could effectively blunt the SFA's powers to bring retrospective cases against players, unless an incident has been completely missed by all match officials. Players have previously been cited for diving to win penalties. The rule states that the compliance officer can bring cases for alleged sending-off offences 'not seen by match officials'. The Meekings case was brought because referee Steven McLean and his team had not seen the ball hit the defender's hand. PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned before the verdict that the SFA was veering into dangerous territory. He said: 'I think you have seen this week from the reaction of players across the country, players have no problem with video evidence being used for incidents that genuinely haven't been seen by the referee. 'Maybe a punch behind the referee's back and fly kick when the ball is away. 'But we think, if the rule has been extended, then it is now erring into re-refereeing a game on a Monday. 'That's not the purpose of video evidence. That's why the English FA and FIFA and UEFA steer away from that. The referee could see the incident on Sunday, he just didn't see the handball.'","Inverness defender Josh Meekings won appeal against one-match ban .

5799,"Sexual assault charges were dropped against Uber driver Maxine Fohounhedo, 30, after he produced an audio recording from the night of the alleged attack . Sexual assault charges against a Chicago Uber driver have been dropped after prosecutors heard a secret recording he made of his passenger the night of the alleged attack. Maxine Fohounhedo, 30, was charged in December with kidnapping and raping a female passenger he picked up after she ordered an UberX ride the month before. The 22-year-old woman told police she was intoxicated  and fell in and out of consciousness during the ride with Fohounhedo. She alleged that she eventually woke up in Fohounhedo's apartment as he was having sex with her, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. The woman told police he then helped her into his car and drove her home. She called police the next day and a rape kit was administered at Swedish Covenant Hospital, the Chicago Tribune reported. Shady Yassin, Fohounhedo's attorney, claims the woman made a pass at his client when he first picked her up and then they 'went back to his place.' 'Whatever happened there did not arise to anything criminal,' Yassin said. According to Yassin, Fohounhedo made the nine-minute recording as he drove the woman home because 'he had a gut feeling he needed to protect himself'. 'She was having a friendly conversation with him,' Yassin said. 'And talking about her boyfriend and her work, and gave him a hug in the end.' Yassin said when Fohounhedo helped the woman out of his car she said 'thank you so much'. The attorney said prosecutors authenticated the recording after Fohounhedo turned over his phone. Shady Yassin, Fohounhedo's attorney, said the woman made the pass at his client when he first picked her up and then they 'went back to his place'. 'Whatever happened there did not arise to anything criminal,' he said. Fohounhedo's wife Sheena (right) said the couple will have to work to get past the incident . Fohounhedo was released from Cook County Jail on Monday night. He has spent the last four months behind bars. Sheena Fohounhedo, his wife, told ABC 7 the couple will have to work to get past the incident but that she is happy her husband is coming home . Fohounhedo was using his wife's Uber account, which is a violation of the company's policy, when he picked up the 22-year-old woman. Uber removed Fohounhedo from the service after he was charged with assault. Yassin said his client wasn't given a chance and that 'everybody immediately thought he was guilty'. He said Fohounhedo has no ill will against Uber but does not plan to work with the company again. Fohounhedo was just one of several Uber drivers who have been accused of sexual assault since the app was launched in the US in 2011. Another woman in Chicago sued the company earlier this year after her driver allegedly locked her in the car and groped her breast, legs and groin before she escaped.","Maxine Fohounhedo, 30, was charged in December with kidnapping and raping a female passenger who ordered an UberX ride .

2403,"Wigan climbed up to third place in the First Utility Super League after exacting sweet revenge on arch-rivals St Helens for October's Grand-Final defeat. The Warriors came out on top 12-4 in a brutal, no-holds-barred contest in front of a spellbound capacity 24,054 crowd at the DW Stadium which contained just three tries but countless examples of rugby league at its finest. Defences reigned supreme and both sets of players were out on their feet long before the end of an absorbing Good Friday duel as the ferocious exchanges, on a glue-pot pitch, began to takes its toll. Wigan Warriors' Dom Manfredi (centre) celebrates with his team-mates after he scores his side's first try. It took a try from Sydney-bound winger Joe Burgess 10 minutes from the end to finally break the champions' resistance. It was a second successive defeat for Saints, who began the season under Keiron Cunningham with six wins in a row, but there was no shame in this loss. Cunningham was forced to turn to a new half-back pairing in Jordan Turner and Lance Hohaia after skipper Jon Wilkin joined Travis Burns on the injury list by pulling a hamstring in training while Paul Wellens, restored to the captaincy, limped off four minutes into the second half to prompt another re-shuffle, . Wigan could hardly have made a better start, with winger Dom Manfredi charging over for a try after just 52 seconds, reclaiming possession after Turner's attempted clearance kick was charged down by prop Lee Mossop. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi went over for the first try as his side exacted revenge over St Helens . Matty Smith kicked the goal to make it 6-0 and Saints had to scramble to prevent Manfredi and his centre Anthony Gelling adding to the Warriors' lead. Wigan were indebted to a terrific last-ditch by George Williams that brought down centre Josh Jones in full flight and, as the momentum shifted towards the visitors, it was no surprise when impressive forward Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook charged over for a try on 15 minutes. Tom Makinson, third choice marskman in the absence of Mark Percival and Burns, was unable to add the goal and Saints suffered a blow when boom second rower Joe Greenwood, just back from an elbow injury, limped off with an ankle problem. As the conditions deteriorated and fatigue set in, the game developed into a war of attrition in the second half with chances few and far between. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi (centre) is tackled by St Helens' Josh Jones (left) and James Roby . The impressive Manfredi was hauled down just short of the line while Saints loose forward Luke Thompson went close for the visitors. The key moment came 10 minutes from the end when Saints turned the ball over 20 metres out from their own line after being penned back by Wigan's tigerish tackling. Wigan substitute prop Ryan Sutton was held up on the line in the next set but the breakthrough came moments later when Burgess won the race to George Williams' grubber kick, touching the ball down with inches to spare. Ryan Hampshire kicked the conversion to put his side two scores in front and that completed the scoring in a pulsating encounter.","Wigan exact revenge on St Helens in Super League Grand-Final rematch .

10511,"A Roma gang accused of selling a newborn  to a childless couple for £6,500 and a car has told a French court that the child was 'a gift' Four Roma men and women appeared in a Marseille court today, accused of human trafficking and being involved in several similar 'baby sales'. Six others are facing related charges in what prosecution documents described as 'a two thousands piece puzzle built around four births'. Human trafficking: Carmen and Mike Gorgan, pictured speaking to their lawyer in the courtroom of Marseille's Criminal Court today, are accused of paying a Roma gang £6,500 and a BMW for newborn baby boy Tony . At the centre of the scandal was Ilie Ionita, a 35-year-old Romanian, and co-conspirators Valeriu Rosu, 42, Florian Stan, 33, and Florin Coman 25. All face up to 10 years in prison and fines equivalent to more than £1million. They deny the charges against them, saying the babies were 'a gift'. The only defendant not in court was Fana Moses, the 32-year-old mother of the baby boy called Tony whom the gang sold. In July 2013, Marseille detectives received an anonymous tip that a Romanian woman had just given birth and had given the child to Mike and Carmen Gorgan, aged 27 and 28. The four accused Roma gang members deny the charges against them, saying the babies were 'a gift' Both were accused of 'complicity in human trafficking', but their lawyer, Patrick Gontart, insisted: 'They do not believe they have done anything wrong'. The Roma gang was arrested as they prepared to board a flight from Italy back to Romania. At first all denied that money or good had been exchanged, but it was quickly established that Mr Gorgan had handed over 9000 euros(£6,565) and the BMW to Ionita. Mr Gontart said: 'For a month and a half, Carmen behaved like Tony's mother and was very well treated.' He said the couple had 'fallen into the trap of many European couples. These are good people who are now unhappy because their child has been placed in a home.' Documents including identity cards were falsified to try and make it look like the parents who bought the baby were the biological mother and father. They had been trying for children unsuccessfully for ten years, the court heard. At least three other cases of babies being sold were then tracked down, both on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica and on the mainland. In all, two boys were sold, while other transactions broke down. All of the children are now back with their biological mothers, or else have been taken into care by social services. OICEM, the organisation against modern slavery, is a civil party in the case – one which it says highlights the growing problem of poor immigrants offering children for sale. Referring to baby Tony's case, OICEM director Nagham Hriech said: 'There was canvassing, exchange and even negotiations.'The case, which is expected to last two days at Marseille Correctional Court, continues.","Roma gang 'sold' newborn baby to childless French couple in 2013 .

Emwazi, who is originally from London, was planning on joining al-Shabaab in Africa but changed his mind after his friends were killed amid accusations they were set up by rival group members. Instead he travelled to Syria where he joined Islamic State and became synonymous with their gruesome beheading videos posted online. Scroll for video .

In an interview with The Independent, Ayman says Emwazi once confided in him that he planned to join al-Shabaab before coming to Syria because Somalia was too dangerous. Ayman, who said he met Emwazi in Syria after ISIS captured his hometown, added: 'Mohammed was obsessed with al-Shabaab, he was angry about what happened in Africa. 'Some of his friends had been killed, some sent to prison and he thought they had been betrayed.' Emwazi became convinced al-Shabaab had been infiltrated by Western spies after friends Bilal al-Berjawi (pictured) and Mohammed Sakr were killed . The friends referred to are likely to be Bilal al-Berjawi and Mohammed Sakr, two members of the 'London Boys' gang of extremists that grew up with Emwazi in Maida Vale, north west London. Al-Berjawi passed through UK Border Control at least five times between 2006 and 2009 as he travelled between London and African terror cells, and helped to radicalise Emwazi while in the UK. Three years ago he was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Somalia, and according to Ayman, Emwazi was convinced that his location had been given to the Americans by fellow members of al-Shabaab during an internal power struggle. Emwazi also believed that another friend, Mohammed Sakr, who at one time had lived next door to al-Berjawi, was also betrayed to his death after he was killed in February 2012, also in Somalia. Emwazi has previously been accused of trying to join al-Shabaab, and was detained in August 2009 after flying to Tanzania in east Africa with a group of friends. They had claimed to be going on a wildlife safari, but were sent back to the Netherlands by security forced, where Emwazi later claimed he was questioned by an MI5 agent who tried to recruit him. Al-Berjawi and Sakr were also detained in Kenya around the same time, but later returned to Africa and were able to make it to Somalia, where they joined the fighting. Ayman claims that Emwazi also intended to return, but after his friends were killed he decided against it, believing al-Shabaab had been infiltrated by Western spies and was too dangerous. He added: 'Perhaps the British should be sorry they did not let him go to Somalia, he would probably be dead now like his friends.' In 2012, Emwazi fled Britain for Syria, despite being on terror watchlists, where he eventually joined the ranks of ISIS. Emwazi was accused of trying to join al-Shabaab in 2009 when he flew to Tanzania before being sent back home by security force. He joined ISIS in Syria in 2012 (pictured, al-Shabaab militants in Somalia) It is thought that during the early stages of the conflict Emwazi was a prison guard, along with three other Britons, leading to them being nicknamed The Beatles. Escaped captives had given him the name John, after Beatles lyricist John Lennon, which eventually became Jihadi John. In previous interviews, French hostages have described how Emwazi talked to them about al-Shabaab and the war in Somalia, making them watch videos of the fighting there. Emwazi first rose to international attention in August 2014 when he appeared in a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley. Since then he has been seen in videos showing the beheading of Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, Peter Kassig, a former U.S. solider. Also murdered at the hands of Emwazi were David Haines and Alan Henning, two British aid workers, and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yakuwa.","Mohammed Emwazi wanted to join al-Shabaab in Somalia, source claims .

8076,"A senior Indonesian government official has praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work. 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. Scroll down for video . Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did . Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution . The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March . 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' Mr Abbott announced Australia's unprecedented diplomatic response on Wednesday morning, just hours after the Bali Nine duo were put to death despite pleas for their deaths to be reconsidered. 'Australia respects the Indonesian system, we respect Indonesia's sovereignty but we do deplore what's been done and this cannot simply be business as usual,' Mr Abbott said. 'For that reason once all the courtesies have been extended to the Chan and Sukumaran families our ambassador will be withdrawn for consultations.' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect'. 'And I expect to be able to discuss further aspects of our relationship with Indonesia when our ambassador Paul Grigson returns to Australia at the end of this week,' Ms Bishop said. The consul general Majel Hind will formally identify the bodies. Ms Bishop hasn't ruled out cutting Australian aid to Indonesia in protest over the executions of Chan and Sukumaran. Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Australia gives Indonesia about $600 million in aid annually, and is its second largest international benefactor behind Japan. Asked if Australia would respond to the executions by reducing the aid budget, Ms Bishop said it was under different consideration to diplomatic actions such as recalling the ambassador. 'Any announcement to the aid budget will be made at budget time in early May,' she told reporters in Canberra. Mr Abbott stressed that Australia has a 'very important' relationship with Indonesia. 'But it has suffered as a result of what's been done over the last few hours,' he said. 'Whatever people think of the death penalty, whatever people think of drug crime, the fact is that these two families have suffered an appalling tragedy and I'm sure that every Australian's thoughts and prayers will be with those families at this time.' The Prime Minister said he understood people's anger at the executions, but said the government did not want to make a difficult situation worse. 'So I would say to people yes, you are absolutely entitled to be angry but we've got to be very careful to ensure that we do not allow our anger to make a bad situation worse,' he said. 'The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is important, remains important, will always be important, will become more important as time goes by. 'While this is a dark moment in the relationship I am confident that the relationship will be restored for the great benefit of both our countries.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten acknowledged Australians had the right to be outraged but rejected talk of boycotts. 'I don't and we shouldn't hold ordinary or individual Indonesian people responsible,"" he said. 'What Australians need to do is campaign against the death penalty wherever it exists.' Backlash begins: At 6am AEST, hundreds of Twitter users were already pledging to 'boycott Indonesia' Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Now share your opinion . The executions by firing squad occurred at 3:25am AEST on Wednesday evening and came despite months of pressure from the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Senior officials were already angered by a series of snubs from the Indonesians. President Widodo repeatedly refused to return Mr Abbott's phone calls on the issue. Ms Bishop was also angered by the Indonesians' decision to announce the executions were going ahead on Anzac Day, one of Australia's most solemn days of remembrance. The Bali Nine duo's families released a short statement on Wednesday morning. 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. Our sons, our brothers. In the 10 years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others,' it read. 'They asked for mercy, but there was none. They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. We too, will be forever grateful.' Following the executions, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said: 'Indonesia has not just robbed two young men of their lives but robbed itself of two examples of the strengths of its justice system.' Other Labor MPs condemned the killings, with Opposition frontbencher Tony Burke saying 'Lives lost. Nothing gained' and Federal Labor MP Anthony Albanese saying 'RIP Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - a tragic loss of human life on a very sad day.' Greens Leader Christine Milne said: 'The lives of these two Australians have been ended by firing squad at the direction of the Indonesian government. We in Australia must continue to advocate for an end to capital punishment.' Stern words: Julie Bishop has pleaded for the Indonesian government not to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for months . Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak. He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts . Immediately following the executions, parliamentary secretary Steven Ciobo tweeted: 'There are few greater displays of abuse of power and regressive thinking than the death penalty #RIP', tweeted. He was joined by western Sydney backbencher Fiona Scott, who said: 'The death penalty is barbaric and inhumane torture. Murder is murder.' Brazil already recalled its ambassador in January when one of its citizens was executed by Indonesia. But Indonesia forged ahead with more executions overnight, killing six others - including a Frenchman - and shrugging off pressure from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. There is also the potential for other ramifications from Australia. Top human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has suggested Australia could withdraw its $600 million of aid to Indonesia per year and redirect it to Nepal. 'Nepal needs it more,' said Mr Robertson, who accused Indonesia of breaching international law in three instances. Ms Bishop and her Labor counterpart, Tanya Plibersek (right), have been a united force in their opposition to the executions . In an interview with ABC's 730 program on Tuesday evening, Ms Bishop refused to detail the consequences for the Indonesian government. 'I don't intend to focus on the consequences,' she said. 'But of course, should these executions proceed in the manner that I anticipate, of course there will be have to be consequences. I don't want to go into the details.' After months of pleading with the Indonesians - even offering a prisoner swap, paid by Australia - officials still worked on Mr Widodo until the last moment. Late on Tuesday evening, the Australian embassy in Jakarta circulated an extraordinary joint statement with the European Union and French government addressed to Mr Widodo. The statement said: 'It is not too late to change your mind.' But with the exception of Filipino convict Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso - who was spared - Mr Widodo did not.","H.M.

6773,"Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, a former minister and the late Muammar Gaddafi's cousin . The most senior member of the Gaddafi clan has laid the blame of the migrant shipwreck that killed about 950 people on the western countries which helped overthrow Colonel Gaddafi. Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, a former minister and Muammar Gaddafi's cousin, said the 'overwhelming chaos' in Libya 'has become a shame that will haunt the countries that had participated in the destruction of the Libyan armed forces in 2011'. But senior Conservative minister William Hague has defended the government's role in helping to overthrow the dictator, who was well-known for his barbaric treatment of the would-be migrants. About 800 people are believed to have died when a fishing boat carrying migrants overturned off Libyan waters, south of the Italian island of Lampedusa, shortly after midnight on Sunday. And Gaddafi's cousin, who was one of several high-profile regime figures who fled to Egypt during the 2011 revolution, believes the only solution for stability in the Mediterranean is to bring back those who surrounded the country's despotic former ruler in government. Mr Gaddaf al-Dam, whose supporters claim could be Libya's next president, said western countries have shed 'the tears of crocodiles over democracy and human rights'. 'The missiles of NATO have installed the gangsters instead of the regime,' he said. 'I express my astonishment. How have super power countries, members of the Security Council, been incapable of realising that they are committing such a crime and not foreseeing the consequences? 'What happened in Libya, Syria and Iraq may extend everywhere... and will burn all the fingers that have participated in it.' Scroll down for video . Former dictator: Western countries helped overthrow Muammar Gaddafi (pictured) and his cousin claims they are to blame for the Mediterranean Sea disaster . Family: Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, pictured here with his cousin Muammar Gaddafi's, blames the migrant shipwreck that killed about 950 people on the West . Local residents and rescue workers help a woman after a boat carrying migrants sank off the island of Rhodes, southeastern Greece . He described the situation in Libya since the fall of his cousin as a 'continuing tragedy'. Mr Gaddaf al-Dam claimed a third of the population had been displaced, men and women had been imprisoned and are subjected to torture, and towns are cities are bombed. But Mr Hague said it would be wrong to think that whatever has happened in Libya in the last few years is the cause of this'. He added on BBC Radio 5 live: 'Let me remind you of something as well, which is that when Colonel Gaddafi was still in power, there were periods when he simply allowed people to do exactly this, to get into boats and try to go to Europe – that was one of the ways in which he put pressure on Europe.' Colonel Gaddafi's 42-year-rule, which ended in 2011, was characterised by tyranny. He murdered political opponents and dissidents, and replaced law with his 'Green Book' of rambling political philosophy, taught in all Libyan schools. He saw himself as the leader of the Third World and used Libya's vast oil wealth to sponsor terror, shipping Semtex to the IRA and sending agents to bring down a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie in Scotland. A migrant carries a baby as they disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Chimera in the harbor of Salerno, Italy today . Tragedy: Infrared images released by the coast guard show the rescue operation after the migrant ship capsized . By the 1990s he had become a pariah, but was rehabilitated in 2004 under the British Labour government with the despot signing an £120million gas contract for Shell with Tony Blair. The Lockerbie bomber was allowed to return to Libya from a UK prison and Gaddafi intelligence officers were even allowed to operate in Britain. He held out for eight months during the Libyan revolutions of 2011, but was eventually found hiding in a drain, dragged out by rebels, beaten and executed. Experts have drawn links between the massive rise in would-be migrants and Colonel Gaddafi - whose people were forced to call him the Guide' - but not for the reasons his cousin insists. The so-called 'deal in the desert' struck by  Tony Blair in 2004 involved the dictator agreeing to crack down on human traffickers as well as renouncing Libya's possession of weapons of mass destruction and decommissioning the country's chemical and nuclear weapons programs. In 2008 Colonel Gaddafi sought to stiff the European Union for £4.1billion a year in return for halting the flows of migrants in and out of Libya. Migrants stand on board Italian Navy ship Chimera before disembarking in the southern harbour of Salerno today . Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country . In October 2010, the EU paid Libya more than £30million to stop African migrants passing into Europe. The Libyan ruler's barbaric treatment of the would-be migrants was widely condemned. It was claimed his officials would round up the migrants and hold them for months or even years in horrendously overcrowded detention centres, where rape, violence and torture were common. The migrants would then typically be deported to Libya's southern border crossing with Sudan - where they were abandoned in a harsh desert environment - or otherwise flown back to their country of origin without any checks on what they would be facing back home. As Blair's much touted 'deal in the desert' turned sour, Gaddafi gave people smugglers in Zuwara the green light to resume their trade and the migrant routes have flourished ever since. But Mr Gaddaf al-Dam said the only way to bring stability back to the country is to bring back the Gaddafis. 'Libya has become like a sick body stricken by viruses,' he said. 'The human trafficking is but one such virus. Such chaotic environment is what created this phenomenon and others.' He also accused the Libyan government of being in league with the criminal gangs. The so-called 'deal in the desert' struck by Tony Blair in 2004 involved the dictator agreeing to crack down on human traffickers . 'Libya now is ruled by extreme criminal gangsters… in alliance with all the world's devils: from drug dealers, human traffickers, exploiters of religion, arms traders, and international mafias. 'IS (ISIS) collaborate with the traffickers by wreaking chaos in Libya in exchange for financial benefits.' 'There is an exchange of financial, political and military interests that Daesh (ISIS) benefit from so as to disrupt the scene and intimidate their enemies and extort them, in fact even make a mockery out of their weakness.' Continuing to worship his late-cousin's legacy, he added: 'He dedicated billions for investment in building schools and hospitals. 'He allowed millions of Africans to work and reside in Libya without any restrictions. He provided free oil on many occasions in order to support neighbouring countries.' Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists  take advantage of the political chaos currently engulfing the country. With ISIS having established strongholds in the towns on Sirte and Derna, and with smaller bases elsewhere in the country, fear of capture and execution at the hands of the radical Islamists is driving the desperate migrants to leave Libya as quickly as they can, dangerously overloading vessels. As well as the spread of ISIS in the country, Libya is currently in a state of civil war - with two rival governments controlling and operating in different areas of the country. People smugglers are taking advantage of the subsequent chaos and confusion tearing the country apart to ply their trade with little to no threat of being caught. Refugee route: Tens of thousands of migrants are fleeing Libya as extremists take advantage of the political chaos engulfing the country . New ground: ISIS has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya (pictured) while building a terrifying support structure in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria . Mr Gaddaf al-Dam added: 'The coming period requires a strong government that has experience in controlling this chaos: a government supported by the Libyan army and police in order for Libya to reach the shores of safety. 'Libya will not stabilise except with the actual participation of the previous regime supporters.' He claims the Gaddafi supporters number two million and are not a party but said it is made up of several major tribes with the support of the Libyan army and police. 'They are the key for a solution, for peace and stability in Libya,' he said. 'They are the political experts, the military personal, the lawyers, the university professors, and the major tribal-leaders. ' Mr Gaddaf al-Dam called for a conference that includes all parties, including ISIS and the Gaddafis. In his last interview with a Western newspaper Colonel Gaddafi accurately predicted a future without him. He told Il Giornale: 'The Mediterranean will become a sea of chaos. The Africans will move en masse towards Europe.' Earlier this year, Mr Gaddaf al-Dam professed that 'not less than half a million' migrants will set sail from Libya to European shores this year. Among them, he claimed, are thousands of terrorists, who will soon be running amok in Europe culminating in a terror strike on the same scale as the September 11 attacks.","Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam says the West is to blame for the 'chaos' in Libya .

2209,"A French artist has given a seedy and derelict motel a makeover by painting the entire property - including its palm trees - a dazzling bright white. Vincent Lamouroux publicly unveiled the project, named 'Projections' in LA's trendy Silver Lake neighborhood and it instantly became a hit with passers-by who stopped to take photos. Mr Lamouroux used an environmentally friendly limewash to coat the so-called Bates Motel, including several towering palm trees and the fence around the rundown property. Dazzling: French artist Vincent Lamouroux has painted a derelict motel in LA's trendy Silver Lake neighborhood completely white, even coating the palm trees . The seedy motel, which has been closed for years, was actually named the Sunset Pacific Motel but got its nickname from its proximity to nearby Bates Avenue and its passing resemblance to the motel in the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece 'Psycho'. Paris resident Mr Lamouroux said: 'The idea behind this project was to cover the entire building and to think about the building as a giant sculpture (on) the scale of the urban landscape. 'With this idea we could provoke ... a strong change in order to create some attention.' Mr Lamouroux has made frequent trips to Los Angeles over the past 15 years. He said he chose white because it 'could bring the most light and could cause a sort of bedazzlement.' Complete whitewash: A man carries paint pots while walking through the interior of what used to be known as Bates Motel due its proximity to nearby Bates Avenue and its passing resemblance to the motel in the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece 'Psycho' Attracting attention:  A passer-by stops to take a picture following the unveiling of the 'projections' prokject yesterday in LA . Explaining the name Projections, he said explained that it refers to the process of spraying the lime wash onto the building - but also that the viewer is able to project ideas and imagination on to the surfaces of the motel. He said: 'It also creates something rather positive; perhaps the idea of a blank projection screen for our desires and wants, and for all our imaginings.' The installation is the culmination of two years work and will be guarded for two weeks before the weather and graffiti artists inevitably reclaim the building. Speaking to LA Observed, he added: 'It was a long process, but not that hard. 'I like the idea that we were able to have around us people who were believers about it. 'It's a great thing to be able to share a dream, starting from an idea and transforming it into a reality. For me, this project is an awakened dream that has turned into reality.'

7121,"A woman who suffers daily abuse because she has a beard is thrilled after learning she will be undergoing laser treatment to get rid of her facial hair for good. Mother-of-two Cheryl Howe, 32, from Morecambe, was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at the age of 12, and suffers from excessive hair growth on her face, breasts, stomach and legs. She has been fighting for six years for treatment on the NHS, spending £2,000 a year on razors, and shaving up to three times a day. Scroll down for video . Cheryl, pictured with her daughter Sharon who is now 14, was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 12 . She suffers from excessive hair growth on her face, breasts, stomach and legs . Along the way she's had support from celebrities such as Kym Marsh, Ted Robbins and Edwina Currie. She finally got approved for NHS funding for laser hair removal treatment, which costs a minimum of £10,000. Cheryl has had initial appointments and is booked in for September this year. She said: 'I'm going to be a real girl and I can't wait. 'I was in tears when I found out. I've suffered years and years of abuse and finally something is happening. 'My hair growth has cost me jobs, relationships - it even ruined my first few years with my daughter. I couldn't be a mum or a wife, because I just didn't feel like a woman.' Cheryl suddenly began growing hair on her chest and legs at the age of 12. She had heavy periods from the age of eight. The 32-year-old says her body hair, shown here growing on her arm, has cost her jobs and relationships . Cheryl fought for six years for treatment on the NHS before finally getting approved. She says she had to shave up to three times a day to keep her face, chin and neck stubble-free . The mother-of-two is booked in for the £10,000 treatment in September this year, to tackle unsightly hair on her stomach, face and chest . She says: 'I was bullied and beaten up at school. I used to get called Gorilla and Cheesy Cheryl.' She was diagnosed with PCOS and doctors prescribed the contraceptive pill, believing that her problems would improve. Cheryl says: 'The pill didn't help at all. I had periods for 28 days a month and the hair just kept on growing. I had thick hair on my face, breasts, stomach and legs. 'My older brother, John, taught me how to shave my face and I had to shave two or three times a day.' Cheryl was warned she would be unlikely to be able to have a baby, but at 17, she had a one-night stand and gave birth to her daughter Sharon, now 14. Cheryl says: 'He was the first boy to ever show me any attention and I had a one-night stand. But I can't regret it, because my daughter came along.' But with so many personal issues of her own, Sharon struggled with motherhood. She walked out on her daughter, leaving her own mother to care for her. Her doctors believed she had suffered a nervous breakdown. She gradually formed a bond with her daughter - but doctors then found two cancerous tumours on her ovary. They were removed, and she was told she would be unable to conceive again. But in January 2008, she fell pregnant for a second time with her son, Jack, now six. This time, the bond was instant and she adored him. Cheryl says: 'Jack made me see life through his eyes. He would cuddle me and say: ""Mummy, I don't mind your prickles."" 'His kindness melted my heart.' Cheryl with her son Jack, now six-years-old (left) and brother (right), called John, who taught her how to shave . Cheryl now has a great relationship with her children Sharon, 12, and Jack, six, pictured . But her relationship with Jack's father broke down, because, Cheryl says, he was unable to cope with her excess hair. She says: 'When we got together, he insisted he didn't mind. But no man likes to see their partner shaving their chest, boobs and chin. It drove us apart.' She has also been targeted by trolls on the internet. Following last year's Eurovision song contest, featuring bearded drag queen act Conchita Wurst, she received Facebook messages saying: 'Did you see yourself on television last night?' and 'Can you see the resemblance?' Cheryl says: 'I had messages pushed through my door and I became too afraid even to go out. I lost my job and my self-esteem was very low. 'But I got lots of support too. People from all over the world apologised for what was said to me. Even Conchita Wurst sent me a message saying ""I really apologise, you shouldn't be penalised."" 'We are all unique. People should judge a person by who they are, not what they look like.' The Morecambe mother-of-two is pictured with her sisters Sheridan (left) and Danielle (right) Cheryl has constantly campaigned for treatment for women whose lives are blighted by the condition. She set up the Inspiration Foundation forum and support group, which currently has 7,000 girls and women with PCOS as members, and has had support from Edwina Currie, Kym Marsh and Ted Robbins. Cheryl also has a campaign page called Stand Up To PCOS. She has now finally received confirmation that she will receive the funding for the treatment. She says: 'My daughter, Sharon, gave me a hug for the first time in years. I hope this might bring us closer. 'Jack says he loves me and my prickles. He doesn't mind how I look. 'This isn't cosmetic. I have a disfigurement. It's horrendous that I've had to wait so long for it. 'I just want to concentrate on the future now.

1360,"Former Rangers striker Marco Negri has revealed he quit the Scottish giants after fearing he was HIV-positive. Negri joined the Ibrox outfit from Italian side Perugia for £3.5million in 1997, scoring a staggering 23 goals in his first 10 league games for the club. However, a series of injuries destabilised his career in Glasgow including a reserve match against Aberdeen on November 13, 2000. Ex-Rangers forward Marco Negri has revealed that he quit the club after fearing he had AIDS . Cosenza (Italy) - 19 goals in 34 league games - (1994-95) Perugia (Italy) - 33 in 60 - (1995-97) Rangers - 32 in 30 - (1997-2001) Vicenza (Italy, on loan) - 1 in 9 - (1999-00) Bologna (Italy) - 0 in 3 - (2001-02) Cagliari (Italy) - 2 in 5 - (2002) Livorno (Italy) 8 in 10 - (2002-03) Perugia - 0 in 3 - (2004-05) During the encounter the then 30-year-old forward was on the receiving end of a crunching tackle that caused his right shinbone to bleed profusely. After hospital tests and treatment for what was perceived as a 'deep wound', Negri returned to action in the New Year to train with the reserve team where he suffered a shooting pain in his right knee and leg. Further scans at Ross Hall Hospital showed an inflammation of the shinbone and more worryingly that properties of his blood had been attacked by a lymphogranuloma or lymphosarcoma - common symptoms for those that suffer with HIV/AIDS. However, in his imminent autobiography 'Moody Blue - The Story of the Mysterious Marco', which is serialised in the Daily Record; the now 44-year-old reveals that his worst fears weren't confirmed after flying to Italy for treatment. 'I was immediately hospitalised. I hadn’t even considered the possibility of being HIV positive but the harsh reality was there in front of me in the medical report, and it was hard to ignore and digest,' Negri wrote. In his  autobiography, Negri (left) reveals his nightmare started after a reserve match vs Aberdeen in 2000 . After months of hospital scans in Scotland, Negri (right) was told in Italy that his blood was absolutely fine . 'I didn’t feel able to deal with such a thing alone. I needed my family around me and wanted to undergo further tests in Italy to understand exactly what was going on, the risks and chances of recovery. 'I had to return to Italy, and not on a temporary basis. I asked my lawyer to speak to Rangers about an early dissolution of my contract. 'They had no objections to the premature ending of our relationship, which was something I really appreciated, although it also showed me how serious my condition was. 'Luckily, I didn’t have to wait long to learn I was simply suffering a stress fracture of the tibial axis of the knee. This diagnosis was given by doctors in Bologna. In Scotland they hadn’t got it right this time, even if the results of three blood tests confirmed some anomalies that couldn’t be overlooked. 'Further tests found my blood to be absolutely fine and there was no need for medication or invasive treatment. My drama had been resolved in the best way possible, and I put behind me the endless days of terror when the worst case scenario was swimming around in my head.'

Ward has played 101 times for the Eagles since joining from boyhood club Portsmouth in May 2012 .

'The relationship with the gaffer and the club helped. I'm excited for what the next few years have in store.

The clip, which was filmed by the creative agency Leo Burnett Toronto for the homeless charity Humans For Humans, is designed to make people think twice about the way that they look at people who sleep rough. Many of the people break down in tears as they read comments like, 'I hate the homeless, I don’t feel sorry for you,' and 'I saw a homeless girl across the street. I almost vomited.' Scroll down for video . A new video that shows homeless people reading out cruel tweets that have been written about them. This couple read out the message: 'I hate the homeless, I don’t feel sorry for you. If you want change let me through it at you as hard as I can at your dirty face' A member of the team who made the video said: 'We set out to give the homeless a voice and put a human face to the individuals so often get mistaken for stereotypes. 'Their reactions will remind you the conversation around the issue needs to change. All humans should work together.' In the video, we see a couple called Tristan and Robyn have been homeless for 10 years read out the message: 'I hate the homeless, I don’t feel sorry for you. If you want change let me through it at you as hard as I can at your dirty face.' A young man called Jesse, who has been homeless for three years, said: 'I hate when it gets cold out because then all of the homeless people get on the bus.' Paul  reads out the tweet: 'I hate seeing homeless people standing in the cold shivering. Be glad when the light turns green' Several of the men and women, who all live in Toronto, break down in tears as they read the hurtful comments. Peter has been homeless for eight year and wells up as he reads out the tweet: 'I wonder if homeless people go to heaven.' Cheryl, who has been without a home for seven years cries as she reads: 'If home is where the heart is then are homeless people heartless? In a separate video, the men and women respond to common misconceptions about people who sleep on the streets. Peter  reads out the tweet: 'I wonder if homeless people go to heaven' Kim, who has been homeless for three years, cries after reading out the message: 'Never understand why homeless people smell of p**s when you can literally p**s anywhere.' Melissa, who has been homeless for 10 years, ended up homeless because she endured an abusive childhood that saw her put into care. She said: 'My biological mother was very problematic she was abusive towards my siblings and I, she set the house on fire and left my sisters and I in the house. 'We were returned to her care and then she wasn’t taking proper care of her us I was taken back into care. 'I ended up in a group home in Toronto where I ran away when I was 17 and I [have been] on my own since.' She reads out the message: 'I was enjoying a latte when I saw a hobo girl across the street. I almost vomited. 'Get back on your side of the bridge, no one likes you.'

Another man called Kim ended up homeless after struggling to cope with the deaths of both his partner and his parents. He said: 'How my journey to homeless really began was through the death of my partner. 'Then dealing with my mother and father’s death kept compounding the grief until it became so heavy that it crushed me. 'There was nothing of any value left. I couldn’t pay the rent and got evicted. I took what clothes I could and I donated all of his clothes to a shelter. 'I took all of the suitcases I had and locked them in the bus terminal lockers and went and sat in City Hall at the fountain and that’s when I spent my first night there.' He cries after reading out the tweet: 'Never understand why homeless people smell of p**s when you can literally p**s anywhere.' Kubby reads out the message: 'Maybe if homeless people took care of themselves and looked pretty we would want to help them but I don’t help yellow teeth' Jesse reads out the tweet: 'I hate when it gets cold out because then all of the homeless people get on the bus' While all of the people in the video have been homeless for a considerable amount of time, a man called Kubby has spent the most amount of time sleeping rough - 47 years. He addresses the allegation that most people who are homeless are alcoholics or drug addicts, telling the cameras: 'People state that if you’re homeless you’re an alcoholic or drug user. 'I was drinking before I was born because my mum was an alcoholic and she drank during the pregnancy, it created health problems for myself and an infant and growing up. 'We’re not all bad people, we’ve got feelings, we’re caring, we have friendships, just give us a chance.' Jesse backs the wish for people to see through the fact that they are homeless and to recognise that they are human beings, just like everyone else. He said: 'Let’s stand together as people, why do we have to always begrudge other people just because of the way they look, the way they sound, the way they smell. 'That is still a person, they’re still drawing breath and they still have a heartbeat, they still love and have sadness, they’re still people.'","A short film highlights the nasty things people say about the homeless .

10525,"Arrested: Veteran William Snyder, 34, has been charged in connection with the disappearance and death of his wife, Kelley Jo Snyder, 34 . The husband of a Pennsylvania mother of three has been charged with abuse of a corpse and evidence-tampering after the discovery of her body over the weekend. Army-veteran William Snyder, 34, was charged hours after the body of his wife, Kelley Jo Snyder, 34, was found in a river near to their home on Saturday. She was last seen alive on Easter Sunday. Police in Renovo say that Snyder has admitted moving the body from their home and also having fabricated a ransom note seeking $60,000 for his wife's safe return. Coroner Zachary Hanna said the cause and manner of death are pending results of toxicology tests. State police have said they expect more charges to be filed after the results are published. Snyder is currently in the Clinton County Correctional Facility on $500,000 bail and was arrested at a motel in the small town of Horseheads on Friday in New York after presumably fleeing last week. He was returned across the state border and charged the next day. A police affidavit seen by PennLive.com claims that Snyder, who uses the name BJ, has admitted removing his wife's body from their home and taking it to the Halls Run river. Recovered: The body of Shelley Jo Snyder was found in a river near to where she lived with her husband . Day out: William and Shelley-Jo Snyder with their son on a day out to the Met Life stadium in New Jersey . He is the alleged to have sent a ransom note to a local restaurant, himself and an email to police demanding money for her safe return. Snyder first reported his wife missing at 12.01 on the Monday following Easter Sunday sparking a huge search of the local area. Snyder and her three children said they had last seen Kelly Jo leave the family home at at around 5.45pm right before they sat down to eat their Easter dinner. She is supposed to have left the home to pick up sweet potatoes, but police claim she never made it the store. Police said they spoke to her 14-year-old son and he told them she had taken her wallet, bank card and identification with her. Family affair: Shelley-Jo was last seen at just before 6.00pm on Easter Sunday when she told her family she was going to buy some sweet potatoes . On Wednesday, during the search of the neighborhood, BJ's sister, T.T. Wertz found her sister-in-laws waller near to her house even though the area had been thoroughly searched. On Tuesday, Snyder spoke to Newswatch 16 before his wife's body was discovered. 'We just hope if she is out there and can see this or someone sees this and has any info to get a hold of us,' said Snyder to the local news station. In court papers, Snyder has admitted to sending the ransom note to his own address and to a local restaurant and an email to police before he was arrested. Neighbors of the pair have expressed disbelief at the turn of events. 'I think they are wrong. I don’t think it was him, so I think they need to do a little more investigating other than pinning on the husband,' said Faith Marr, a neighbor to Newswatch 16.","Husband William Snyder has been charged with evidence tampering .

8911,"(CNN)The head of the Libyan Army has rejected the possibility of cooperating with any EU military intervention in his country intended to stem the flow of undocumented migrants trying to reach Europe. In an exclusive interview Friday with CNN's Becky Anderson, Libyan army head Gen. Khalifa Haftar said Libyan authorities had not been consulted and, in any event, military action would not solve the problem. ""We will certainly not cooperate, because we were not involved in resolving this issue,"" Haftar said. ""The decision was taken without consulting the legitimate Libyan side."" The European Union is struggling to cope with an increasing number of people crowding into unseaworthy boats and trying to reach European shores. Many of the travelers are fleeing violence and poverty in Libya and elsewhere in the region. The capsizing of one vessel last weekend left an estimated 900 people dead. EU leaders are considering a plan that would involve military action against people smugglers at the source -- before they load their boats with human cargo. Of necessity, such an operation would involve operations within the territory of North African countries. But Haftar expressed dismay at the prospect in his interview with CNN. ""Military action against Libyan territory is an unwise decision,"" he said. ""You need to deal with the Libyan crisis as a whole. We are a sovereign country that needs to be respected despite what we are going through right now."" Haftar did not respond directly when he was asked whether Libyan authorities would confront any European forces within its territory. ""The European Union needs to stand with the Libyan people to solve the crisis instead of taking such decisions,"" the general said. ""The migrant crisis affects them. But why don't they see that our problems are also very important? It's important for them to support us either on the humanitarian front or on the security front."" Pressed on the point, Haftar replied, ""We do what's in the interest of the Libyan people. The European Union is looking after its own interests so we will also look after ours."" But he said Libya is open to other kinds of cooperation on the issue of migration. ""If they take the right approach, we will certainly cooperate,"" he said, referring to EU authorities. ""The appropriate approach will benefit Libya and its fight against terrorism. And I repeat, that means lifting sanctions against Libya -- specifically those against the army.""","Head of Libyan army tells CNN Libyan authorities have not been consulted .

4186,"Nine British Muslims caught trying to cross into Syria are no longer welcome in England and should find a new country to live, Labour's Simon Danczuk has said. The outspoken Rochdale candidate said it was 'unacceptable' that people who were prepared to join ISIS should be free to come home. It comes after nine members of the same family were arrested in Turkey – including the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor in Rochdale. Scroll down for video . Waheed Ahmed (right) - the son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - and his cousins walk into the Turkish Police Department's Foreigners' office today after being caught trying to cross into Syria . The family – including Councillor Shakil Ahmed's son Waheed, his cousins, aunt and four children – are expected return to the UK from Turkey this week. Coun Ahmed, 45 – who was photographed with Labour leader Ed Miliband just weeks ago – served alongside Mr Danczuk's wife Karen on the Town Council until her resignation in January. But Mr Danczuk today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to Britain without facing any terror charges. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Danczuk said: 'I think I speak for the vast majority of people in Rochdale in saying that this family will not be welcome back in Rochdale.' Mr Danczuk added: 'The Islamic State in Syria are carrying out sickening and barbaric acts of inhumanity and anyone who pledges their allegiance to this cruel and twisted ideology will rightly be seen as an enemy of the UK. 'Waheed and his family were apprehended trying to get into Syria and had they been allowed to cross the border then I've been given to believe Waheed would now be getting trained up to fight for ISIS. Mr Danczuk said they were not welcome back in Rochdale . 'The police have to recognize this, because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like ISIS could be allowed to return to civilian life in Rochdale and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable.' It shares a border with part of Syria controlled by rebel factions including those linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Rochdale nine are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. The three men and two women, aged between 21 and 47, were taken to a hospital with their children, aged one, three, eight and 11 after being apprehended last week. Photographs showed Waheed Ahmed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters and others hoping to reach Islamic State-held areas of Syria and Iraq. The Ahmed family are originally from Kashmir but settled in Rochdale in the 1980s and have lived in their current home since 2006. Coun Ahmed posted a picture of himself with Labour leader Ed Miliband on his Facebook page just before Christmas. Their arrest came after Yahya Rashid, 19, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism after flying into Luton Airport from Istanbul.

Waheed smiled in a car as he left a hospital after undergoing medical checks and fingerprinting in Hatay southern of Turkey last week . He is suspected of acting as an Islamic State smuggler, paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group. Mr Danczuk said the number of Britons fleeing the country to join ISIS – now thought to number more than 600 – exposed the failure of the Government's anti-terror strategy. He said: 'I have spent the last few days in discussions with the Foreign Office minister, Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, local authority leaders, religious groups and local people.' Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the British family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as ISIS fighters . The outspoken candidate added: 'The message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred, exclusion and intolerance, there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization. 'I do not think the Government's Prevent strategy is working and we need a much smarter approach from all the authorities to stop this cancer spreading.'

1882,"It's been just a few days since Andy Murray tied the knot to his long term girlfriend Kim Sears. But already his mother Judy is hopefully that he will soon take the next step and start a family. The 55-year-old tennis coach told Closer magazine this week: 'I'm really looking forward to being a granny. I've always wanted to have grandchildren, but I had to be patient and let them get married first.' Scroll down for video . Andy Murray's mother Judy has revealed that she can't wait for her son to have children with his new wife Kim Sears . Judy went on to reveal that she wasn't sure when her 27-year-old son would have children but she knows that he wants them. She said that she will take an active part in their lives and that she can't wait to teach them about tennis. Judy also said that following her stint on Strictly Come Dancing last year she taught her tennis champion son some basic dance moves. 'I showed Andy part of the basic steps for the waltz, as he was going to be best man at his friend's wedding. So before his own wedding he already knew some steps and was confident about taking to the dance floor.' Andy and Kim married this weekend at a service in Dunblane Cathedral, with the bride wearing a Jenny Packham dress . The ceremony was followed by a reception at Cromlix House, Murray's luxury hotel near Dunblane . In a later interview on the BBC's One Show Judy spoke about the wedding itself. She said that it was a prouder moment than when Andy won Wimbledon in 2013: 'Yeah, I think so. I mean it was just such a happy family occasion. 'It was the perfect day from start to finish even despite the hailstones and the snowstorms that we had during the course of the morning. It was lovely, just lovely.' Judy continued: 'It really was a perfect day. It was a very, very happy day and I think everybody was very relaxed and very chilled. 'They've been together for a long time so to see them getting married with all their friends and family around them, and in Dunblane, for me that was very, very special to be able to share it with the people in Dunblane who give so much love and support all the time for him. 'They made such a huge effort and so many of them turn out in not great weather and were there for hours.' Andy and Kim married at Dunblane Cathedral with a service led by the Rev Colin Renwick. The British tennis number one sported a blue and green kilt for the occasion while Sussex-born Sears, 27, wore an embroidered Jenny Packham gown with three-quarter-length sleeves and a long veil. Among the guests were Murray's brother Jamie, divorced parents Judy and William, grandparents Shirley and Roy Erskine and former British tennis number one Tim Henman and his wife Lucy. The ceremony was followed by a reception at Cromlix House, Murray's luxury hotel near Dunblane. Judy attended the wedding wearing a smart white dress coat with taupe coloured heels . In a note written to staff at the hotel Kim said: 'Thank you to Graeme and every single one of you at Cromlix who worked so hard to make this weekend the best of our lives – a special place filled with very special people! X' Andy and Kim met at the US Open in 2005 when they were both aged 17, and became engaged in November. They are believed to have asked guests to make a donation to charities rather than buy wedding presents. Before the big day Andy revealed that he was not nervous about the wedding, but he is nervous about having children. He told BBC Sport: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.'","Judy Murray has revealed to Closer that she can't wait to be a granny .

6496,"George Kidd, the chief commissioner of The Direct Marketing Commission, said it would be investigating two firms . Two firms exposed by the Daily Mail as selling private information are to be probed by the industry watchdog. B2C Data sold our undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people – including details about their pension pots, incomes and investments. The second firm – Data Bubble – supplied our team with health details on 3,000 patients – such as whether they suffered from high blood pressure, arthritis or even bladder problems. The Direct Marketing Commission said it would probe both companies over claims that they had breached the rules on the sale of private data. It confirmed it was ‘formally investigating two companies following allegations in the Daily Mail that personal data was shared inappropriately and without the consent of users’. George Kidd, the chief commissioner, said: ‘The allegations in the Daily Mail are serious. People must be able to trust those with whom they share their data. We will look carefully at the roles and conduct of these two companies and advise the Direct Marketing Association on our findings quickly.’ The firms are already at the centre of a major probe by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which said the sale of such details was ‘on the face of it, a very serious breach of the Data Protection Act’. In meetings covertly filmed by our reporters, bosses at B2C Data were seen boasting of how they held thousands of details on every family in Britain. One, Gareth Doran, boasted: ‘We know what clothes they buy, what health products they buy, where they go on holiday, how many times they go on holiday, what income they’ve got, whether they have children.’ Data Bubble bosses offered to provide our reporters with the names of people with ‘different ailments’ for around 16p each. When asked how the information was obtained, the firm’s owner, hypnotherapist Joanne Clayton, said: ‘It could be people who bought mobility products from a catalogue … or even if they’ve been on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing help on the flight with regards to that, we can then identify that they actually have problems with mobility.’ Data Bubble owner Joanne Clayton, pictured, said that they obtained information from people who brought products in a mobility catalogue . Both companies sold the records despite not carrying out checks on the Mail’s bogus cold calling firm. Had they done so they would have quickly discovered it was simply a website and was not registered or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The announcement follows calls – led by David Cameron – for a clampdown on companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent. The Prime Minister suggested on Monday night that the law would be tightened if loopholes were being exploited by unscrupulous cold callers.","The Direct Marketing Commission probing B2C Data and Data Bubble .

724,"Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson has revealed she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, shared the news  through a statement published by People magazine on Tuesday. She explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. Scroll down for video . By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy . 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress. 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health,' Katie Couric wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by Glenne Headly. Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Admiration: Singer Josh Groban also sent his best wishes to the actress on Twitter on Tuesday . By her side: Actress Christina Applegate also sent her love to Wilson . Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.","The 58-year-old actress revealed her diagnosis in a statement on Tuesday .

2371,"Support: Kai Windsor, now 10, with his mother Rachel . Like most boys, he always preferred football to dolls. But Kai Windsor started life as a girl – and knew from the age of three that he had been born into the wrong body. Christened Kaia, he would shun traditional girls’ toys in favour of kicking a ball around. By four, he refused to wear dresses – and at six he wanted his hair cut short and developed a boyish awkwardness around girls. By nine, he had finally broken the truth to his mother Rachel, 37, telling her: ‘I’m really a boy.’ Now, at the age of ten, Kai is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty to stop him developing into a woman. Miss Windsor, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: ‘As a toddler, Kai only wanted to play ball. As a girl, he had no interest in any dolls and made a beeline for boy’s toys. ‘And as soon as he began school, he only wanted to wear trousers as the other boys did. Soon after, I noticed he went red whenever girls were around.’ Kai is not alone in facing gender problems. The number of transgender referrals to the NHS for children under 11 has quadrupled since 2009. Like many parents in her situation, Miss Windsor had never heard of children facing such issues. But the single mother, who runs a health juice business, said Kai had ‘amazing support’ from his primary school. He was given counselling when his schoolwork started to suffer, and later decided to confront the issue head-on. ‘They were the ones who suggested Kai should have counselling,’ she said. ‘Then when he came out as transgender, they sent a letter out to all the parents in his year to explain he now wanted to be referred to as a boy. ‘Staff then held a special lesson for all the year to explain about being transgender. And now they are even in the process of building unisex toilets to make life easier for Kai and other children like him.’ Kaia pretty in pink, aged four, pictured left, and dressing up as a pirate, at five, pictured right . When Kai was born there was no outward sign he was anything other than female. Miss Windsor, who also has a daughter Jasmine, 16, from a previous relationship, said: ‘As a toddler I usually put Kaia in dresses and bought her lots of dolls. Meanwhile, as her blonde hair grew, I put in pigtails. It simply never occurred to me she wouldn’t be as feminine as her sister.’ She added: ‘Looking back Kai knew then he was a boy. He had no interest in dolls, preferring to play with a football. And when we were out he’d head straight for the boy’s section in shops, asking for Spiderman toys.’ At seven, Kai wanted his hair cut shorter. But his grades started suffering and he was later given counselling at school. Within a few weeks, his behaviour and schoolwork improved and last year he officially became transgender after telling his mother one morning. Transgender Kai is now happy in his skin at last and is now set to undergo hormone treatment . Meanwhile, his grades immediately improved. ‘Once people stopped referring to Kai as a girl and he could just be the little boy he wanted, he was so much happier,’ she said. Kai is now set to have hormone treatment to curb puberty. If at the age of 16, he wants to complete the full transition to an adult man, he will be offered gender reassignment surgery. Miss Windsor added: ‘There have been plenty of tears. It is hard to see your child going through such turmoil. But whatever happens I will always be there to support Kai. ‘And right now it is just a wonderful relief to see him happy in his own skin at last.’","Kai Windsor knew from  three that he had been born in the wrong body .

10089,"The bereaved teenage son of a Tulsa man shot and killed by a 73-year-old volunteer deputy says his father's killer should have never been on a police force. 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad,' Aidan Fraley said of Robert Bates. The 16-year-old told NBC he believes everyone on the Tulsa force is to blame for his father the April 2 death of his father Eric Harris and says 'they should all go down.' 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad': Aidan Fraley (right), 16-year-old son of slain unarmed Tulsa suspect Eric Harris (left) has spoken out to say that his father's 73-year-old killer should never have been deputized and given a gun . 'They should all go down': Fraley (here with his uncle Andre Harris), says all the Tulsa police who allowed Bates to become a cop should be held accountable for his death . Meanwhile, his own mother--who calls Harris her 'soulmate'--has already forgiven his killer. 'The Lord has forgiven me for my sins, and who am I not to forgive him?' Fraley told NBC as she spoke out on the case for the first time. Her young son, however, is not ready to forgive and wants to see the other police officers at the scene brought to justice. 'They were involved in it,' he said. 'One of the dudes had his knee on his head, and I feel like that played a part in his death after the shooting.' Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Defense attorneys released some of the training records Saturday for a 73-year-old volunteer sheriff's deputy charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect in Oklahoma. The records for Robert Bates include certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008. Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Bates' attorneys said the 64 pages of records released to The Associated Press and other news organizations include records Bates copied and kept for himself. Although there are time gaps in the documents provided, some of the records seem to indicate Bates was proficient in firearms and dozens of other training courses. 'For the first time today, we feel like someone's starting to look at the other side of this as far as his qualifications,' Scott Wood, an attorney for Bates, said after the documents were released. The Tulsa County volunteer deputy has disputed a Tulsa World report that sheriff's office supervisors were ordered to falsify his training records. The World said at least three of Bates' supervisors were transferred for refusing to go along with the requests, and said it consulted multiple sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, but it gave no indication how those sources were familiar with the situation. Bates told NBC's 'Today' show on Friday that he was certified for his position and had the documentation to prove it. Harris' family attorney - who had questioned Bates' qualifications as a reserve deputy - did not return a message seeking comment Saturday. A call to the district attorney's office rang unanswered, and the sheriff's office referred questions to Wood. 'I want to do everything I can to make sure that people know that this allegation of falsified records is not true,' Wood said. Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris .","Aidan Fraley, 16, says his father Eric Harris' killer Robert Bates should never have been allowed to work as a Tulsa deputy .

4378,"Motherwell have vowed to go to battle with the SPFL over the issue of free entry to the Premiership play-offs for season-ticket holders. And the Fir Park side are set to win powerful backing for their revolt from Championship promotion challengers Rangers and Hibernian. Under existing rules, the SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds from the six play-off ties for redistribution among the clubs. But a bid by the league board to force play-off finalists to charge all fans a minimum price of Â£15 for the play-off ties was withdrawn at a meeting last Thursday. Motherwell will go to battle with the SPFL over free entry to the Premiership play-offs for season-ticket holders . Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish 11th . Expressing unease among the play-off finalists that the SPFL might be using the ties to milk supporters, Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish in the Premiership play-off place. 'All our focus at Motherwell in the next four games is fully on avoiding the play-offs altogether,' said Burrows. 'We fully accept and appreciate that there are rules on this in place. 'But, in the eventuality that we are in 11th place come the play-offs, then it is not our intention to charge our season-ticket holders for the play-off final at Fir Park. 'We believe we have sold them tickets which entitle them to the full story of the season.' Rangers sources said last night that the club have yet to reach a final decision on whether to seek an SPFL exemption which would allow them to let their 25,000 season ticket holders into play-off games for free. The SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds but Motherwell want to offer free tickets . Hibs gained a one-off dispensation to give their most loyal fans free admission to last season's home play-off clash with Hamilton. Sportsmail understands, however, that SPFL lawyers have already warned clubs that attempts to do the same this season will be strongly resisted as it would constitute a breach of league rules. Last week, a resolution by Hibs and Motherwell to have the 50-per-cent levy on play-off gates cut in half was defeated. Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor . Accused of a cash grab to keep more of the play-off cash, Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor for the last two seasons.

6257,"Break-ups can be hard enough to deal with but two women were left with permanent reminders of their failed relationships thanks to having their ex-partners' names tattooed on their bodies. Jessica Hardy, 23, from Hereford, was so desperate to remove her former flame's name from her forearm when she met her new man, Ryan, she tried to burn it off with acid. 'I'm desperate to get rid of it, I have bad dreams about it,' she said on Channel 5 show Tattoo Disasters. Scroll down for video . Jessica Hardy was so desperate to remove her former flame's name from her forearm she used acid . The mother-of-one said she couldn't afford laser removal surgery to have the tattoo removed so when she heard about acid peels for the skin, she thought she had an ideal solution. 'I came across a YouTube video about acid peels so I thought that would be the way to get rid of my tattoo. The kit cost £25 online and I thought ""bargain"".' But instead of removing her tattoo as she hoped, Jessica's dangerous DIY treatment gave her chemical burns. A chemical peel should be applied by a beauty professional as it's designed to damage the skin in a controlled way. The body responds to the damage by healing and rejuvenating the skin - supposedly making it look younger. But Jessica applied the acid without diluting it with water or reading the instructions. As a result, it immediately caused her skin to burn and blister. Jessica's tattoo, left, featuring the name of her ex, and the burns she suffered, right, after applying acid . Six painful applications left Jessica's skin red raw and scabby - and the tattoo remained . She said: 'It felt like someone had poured boiling water on my arm and then got a lighter to it. 'After five minutes it went white and blistered, then started peeling, after three days it went all scabby. 'I didn't want to get it checked in case the nurses thought I was self-harming and I didn't want them to take the acid off me as I still wanted it.' Despite her painful first encounter with the acid, Jessica repeated the treatment another six times. Her skin became red raw, scabby and inflamed - and worst of all, the tattoo was still visible. Realising her DIY treatments were a painful failure, Jessica finally sought the advice of tattoo artist Aaron Mullen. He said: 'I have never seen anything like it before, my first reaction was shock, she shouldn't have taken such a drastic measure to use acid on her skin.' Jess, left, regretted getting her ex-boyfriend's name tattooed on her bikini line, right . He recommended laser removal surgery but said Jessica would have to wait until her skin has healed from the acid burns. Jessica said: 'I regret doing the acid now as I have made process slower. It will be another six to nine months till it will be completely gone.' Another woman keen to get rid of a tattoo featuring the name of an ex is Jess, 23, a dental nurse, from London. She appears on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters this week where she reveals her regrets over her tattoo. 'My boyfriend Jack and I got matching tattoos. Then we broke up and I'm left with his name tattooed on me in an awkward position below my bikini line. 'I regret it every single day. It upsets me and I'm constantly reminds me of what happened when I look at it. I definitely shouldn't have done it, it was a really big mistake,' she said. Jess said the tattoo had seemed like a good idea at the time but now she's been dumped by Jack, it's a permanent reminder of the love she's lost. Jess realised the tattoo was a big mistake when Jack dumped her . The dental nurse managed to get the old tattoo covered up with a new one by tattoo artist David Kaffri . Before, left, and after, right, shots reveal how Jess no longer has Jack's name visible on her body . 'I was in love with him and I thought he was in love with me. We got matching tattoos as we thought we could be together forever,' she said. 'A year-and-a-half later he decided he wanted to be single when he went to uni and broke up with me. When he broke up with me, I said ""I have your name tattooed on me, what am I going to do?""' Jess sought the advice of skin expert Dr Sam Bunting who told her: 'You have two options - one is to get rid of it altogether and that would involve using laser, which is quite a long, painstaking process and will cause some discomfort. 'The other is to change it so the word Jack isn't distinguishable.' Jess decided on the latter and enlisted the help of tattoo artist David Kaffri, who is no stranger to ridding people of tattoos featuring the name of an ex. He said: 'I like it when people come to me with a tattoo they hate and I can transform it into one they love. 'When I first saw Jess' tattoo, I thought, ""Oh My God that's a bad mistake"". The ""Jack"" is quite substantial. 'Names are a common cover-up. In the tattoo world it's believed to be a jinx, if you put someone's name on your body, it will end up bad.' David designed a feminine paisley style tattoo to cover up the name and Jess was delighted with the end result. She said: 'I love it, it looks amazing, Jack is no more, you can't see the old tattoo at all. I feel like a weight is off my shoulders, it has a closed a chapter for me, now I can finally move on. 'Now I can look down and see a nice tattoo instead of bad memories.'

The judge also denied a motion for visitation. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. On March 16, Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness. Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor, who represents Cassandra's mother, Jackie Fortin, released a written statement after receiving the judge's decision Wednesday: ""We are disappointed in this ruling, not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence. We're conferring with our clients now about next steps, including whether to take another appeal."" Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then.  Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them. Cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned, according to Michtom. ""She's seen in her case the side effects weren't bad, and she's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment,"" he said. Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month. Michtom and Taylor failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Joette Katz, the commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, told CNN in March the agency is ""very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life."" The agency has denied CNN's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians. According to Michtom, the Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn't. He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before. Representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with Michtom and Taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once Cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of April -- and that she'll be allowed to return home. So for now, Cassandra is said to spend her days reading, watching TV and drawing. ""The hospital is effectively jail,"" Michtom said.","Judge won't allow teen leave hospital before her last chemotherapy treatment .

Cassandra C. is now in remission and is no longer opposed to the chemotherapy treatments ."
9302,"Patients who are too fat could be denied routine operations to save money, a survey of health bosses has revealed. More than a third of NHS trusts are considering rationing some types of surgery and other treatments. Several have admitted they may impose 'eligibility' rules which could affect smokers as well as the overweight. More than a third of health trusts are considering rationing some types of surgery and other treatments to save money, according to a new study . The criteria for accepting patients for operations would be based on their Body Mass Index, which measures obesity. When senior managers at 67 Clinical Commissioning Groups – local health trusts – were asked, 39 per cent said they were planning to 'limit access' to routine treatment for financial reasons. Procedures affected include varicose vein treatment, hip and knee replacement, and breast reduction surgery. Others said smokers might be denied some treatments, most commonly IVF. Senior doctors criticised the plans and accused health managers of denying patients vital treatment simply because they were considered to be 'undeserving'. Dr David Paynton, of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'Decisions about whether our patients are eligible for surgery or treatment need to be made on a case-by-case basis and by whether surgery will benefit a patient's long-term physical and mental health. 'It should not be the role of CCGs to impose blanket bans on patients' access to surgery, nor to decide who is and who is not deserving of potentially life-saving treatments based on their lifestyle choices. Obese patients could be denied varicose vein treatment, hip and knee replacement, pictured, and breast reduction surgery, while smokers could be banned from having IVF on the NHS . 'Of course, some procedures cannot be performed on patients who are above a certain weight. 'In these cases, a clinical decision needs to be made about whether surgery would be beneficial if the patient lost weight – but this is a separate issue.' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: 'Each case must be individually assessed and each decision must be ethical and in the best interests of the patient. 'It is easy to target vulnerable patients and we must be very careful not to unfairly discriminate against people who aren't always able to speak out.' A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'If health bodies stop patients from having treatments on the basis of cost alone, then we will take action against them.' There are 211 CCGs in England so the survey by the Health Service Journal covered just under a third. Last year, a CCG in Devon threatened to ban all non-urgent treatments for anyone severely obese with a BMI above 35. This is equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman of 16st or a 6ft man being 18st 13lb. After an outcry, the policy was dropped. A survey by GP magazine last month found that 80 per cent of CCGs ration at least one procedure to patients who are very obese. Doctors have blamed excess sugar and carbohydrates for the surge in obesity – not the lack of exercise. They said poor diet was now recognised as being responsible for more disease than physical inactivity, alcohol and smoking combined. Yet, said the experts led by cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, the public wrongly believed that obesity was due to a sedentary lifestyle. The doctors claimed that obesity has rocketed in the past 30 years, despite little change in physical activity levels. ‘This places the blame for our expanding waistlines directly on the type and amount of calories consumed,’ said Dr Malhotra. ‘Let us bust the myth of physical inactivity and obesity. You cannot outrun a bad diet.’ In the British Journal Of Sports Medicine, the doctors added that the ‘false perception’ on the cause of obesity stems from corporate marketing ‘chillingly similar’ to that used by the tobacco industry. They cited Coca-Cola associating its products with sport ‘suggesting it is OK to consume their drinks as long as you exercise’. Dr Malhotra, who works at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, is an adviser to the campaign group Action on Sugar. Around two-thirds of Britons are overweight or obese. The Government’s obesity adviser Professor Susan Jebb said the doctors failed to note that the best way to lose weight was combining a better diet with physical activity. ‘Rather than trade one off against the other – sugar vs fat, diet vs activity, individual vs population – we need to take action across the full range,’ she added. Tackling obesity without addressing physical activity was ‘tying one hand behind our backs’ said the professor. ‘It makes good sense to seek to change both diet and activity behaviours.’","More than a third of health trusts are considering rationing some surgery .

Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. GOALKEEPER: PETR CECH . Cech is the man for the big occasions and the big games. The last one was the (Champions League) final in Munich. Preparing a goalkeeper's station is like mathematics - nothing is like an accident. He is somebody in the dressing room with a big character and he's a leader as well. Florent Malouda picked Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech to start in between the sticks for his Fantasy XI . Malouda's Fantasy Football XI . RIGHT BACK: DAVID LUIZ . I know with this offensive mentality that I have in my team he won't be frustrated so I trust him to follow the manager's orders and stay in that right back position. He's funny, but when it comes to reason, he is a guy that steps in and takes big responsibility in a team. CENTRE BACK: LILIAN THURAM . He is a real defender with lots of experience. He is very, very solid when all the others will take the risk. I need two leaders. CENTRE BACK: JOHN TERRY . The second one is the captain. I pick a team with a lot of characters. I needed somebody to lead them and JT is a natural born leader. I need a player like him to make the team perform. LEFT BACK: ERIC ABIDAL . I wanted to pick Ashley Cole because we had a great time together and we had a great understanding, but I have to pick my close friend Eric Abidal. I started to play with him during my time at Lyon. He's a little bit like David Luiz in the dressing room always having fun and joking around. He has this faith and to sacrifice himself to help you be a better player. Malouda included Chelsea defender John Terry (far left, pictured in 2007) for his leadership qualities . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER: CLAUDE MAKELELE . He is a leader and for me a tactical genius. He was the kind of guy telling you, 'be cool and and just stay in that position'. MIDFIELDER: PATRICK VIEIRA . He is just a legend and makes things so simple. Playing with him was easy and that's the kind of guy when you train with them you learn a lot of things. He's a fighter and you need that fighting spirit because not every game will be easy. Former Arsenal and France midfielder, pictured with Malouda in 2006, starts in a three-man central midfield . RIGHT MIDFIELDER: FRANK LAMPARD . In my team you're going for goals and Lamps is a great professional and a great example to follow. Arriving in this league I remember Didier Drogba telling me, 'watch (him) because you have to learn'. I've seen so many times (Lampard) score winning goals. LEFT MIDFIELDER: ZINEDINE ZIDANE . I would give him the freedom. Everytime you are stressed, everything is in slow motion for him. My team will play with style and class with Zizou. Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry, who played alongside Malouda for the France national team, start in attack . STRIKER: THIERRY HENRY . I remember when I arrived in 2004 (in the national team), he welcomed me. I never even knew Thierry Henry even knew me. He loves the game so much and he's an Arsenal legend. STRIKER: DIDIER DROGBA . I met him when we first played together in the second division in France at Guingamp. Watching him get to the world class level when he scored that header coming out of nowhere in Munich. Then he had that opportunity with that last penalty. He gave us the Champions League which made me so, so happy. He's a striker for the big occasions and big games.

2348,"Bearing in mind he’s a dog, Don the border collie did a pretty good job yesterday of piloting a tractor across a motorway. To be fair, however, this probably wasn’t the first thought to strike rush-hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them. Like a scene from Wallace and Gromit, the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank, on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier. Don's owner Tom Hamilton (pictured) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls . The tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road. Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks . Despite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt – but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things. Traffic Scotland tweeted a bizarre warning that there may be hold-ups ‘due to a dog taking control of tractor’, adding: ‘Nope, not joking.’ Appropriately, they couldn’t resist the hashtag: ‘#maycausetailbacks’. Observers and Twitter commentators joined the pun fun by speculating: ‘Police investigating – so far no leads’; or the inevitable: ‘This is barking.’ The incident happened at junction 13 of the M74, near Abington in South Lanarkshire. Sheep farmer Tom Hamilton was travelling across a field in the John Deere Gator farm vehicle with his companion in the passenger seat during their morning rounds. Behind the wheel: Don leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire during rush hour . The vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the M74 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrow . Moments after he got out of the vehicle, it took off with Don at the wheel. Safely back at nearby Kirkton Farm yesterday with Don at his side, Mr Hamilton explained: ‘I was sorting out one of the lambs and hadn’t put the brake on. ‘When I turned around I saw it racing towards the motorway. I ran after it but I couldn’t catch up.’ Traffic Scotland tweeted the news that a dog had 'taken control of a tractor' before adding, 'nope, not joking' Officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and Don was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby Kirkton Farm . Remarkably, drivers managed to avoid the runaway vehicle before it came to crashing halt, and none was hurt. Nor did the black and white border collie (a breed noted for its intelligence and obedience) panic or flee in terror. ‘He didn’t even bark,’ Mr Hamilton said. Police said Don had set the vehicle in motion by inadvertently leaning on the controls. ‘So far people seem to find it amusing,’ Mr Hamilton said. ‘But I think Don’s driving days are over.’ Monty, a giant schnauzer cross, was pictured driving a mini down a race track in New Zealand in 2012 .","The bizarre incident happened on M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire .

7329,"A Manchester canal was turned into a giant bubble bath after fire crews tackling a nearby chemical plant blaze saw their water mix with a detergent creating a six foot wall of foam. The Ashton Canal was filled with heavy suds which appeared after a fire at an industrial unit occupied by a drug development company. It is believed that the water used by firefighters to dampen down the flames mixed with the detergent being stored in the burning buildings. Scroll down for video . The Ashton Canal in Manchester, which was turned into a giant bubble bath when fire crews tackled a blaze at a nearby chemical plant . It is believed that the water used by firefighters to dampen down the flames mixed with the detergent being stored in the burning buildings . Three-year-old Jason Kernick looks out of the window of his family's canal boat as they try to navigate their way through the foam . This then turned into a huge wall of foam when it drained into the canal, which runs in the shadow of Manchester City's Etihad Stadium. Now the Environment Agency have launched an investigation to assess if the foam has impacted on wildlife after concerns were raised for the safety of fish in the affected waters. A spokesman for the agency said: 'The Environment Agency is investigating after receiving reports of foam on a 30 metre stretch of the Ashton Canal, Manchester. 'Initial investigations by Environment Agency officers show that there appears to have been minimal impact on water quality, but our officers will continue to monitor and respond as necessary.

A cyclist takes a picture on his mobile phone as the foam comes up on to the cycle path. The Environment Agency are investigating to assess of the foam has harmed any wildlife . The foam reached as high as six foot in some places and covered a 30 metre stretch along the water in the Clayton area of Manchester . 'We are working with the fire service and taking samples of the foam to understand what it is made of, and what impact it may have on local wildlife in and around the canal.' At the height of the blaze on Sunday afternoon, which caused the foam, up to 50 firefighters were tackling the fire and police were also forced to wear face masks. Families in east Manchester were urged to say indoors after a blast was reported at the industrial unit, which is just a few hundred yards from the Manchester City training ground on the Etihad campus. The fire at the chemical factory next to Manchester City's Etihad stadium send a huge plume of smoke across the city on Easter Sunday . Police wearing face masks went around neighbouring streets with loudspeakers urging people to stay inside while the fire raged . Police officers also told children on bikes and mothers pushing prams near the scene to go home and went around neighbouring streets with loudspeakers urging people to stay inside. A huge plume of smoke also turned the sky black and could be seen right across the city and even into Salford. According to Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, the fire was fueled by wooden pallets and unidentified chemicals but an investigation into the cause of the fire is still ongoing.","The Ashton Canal became filled with heavy suds due to a 6ft wall of foam created by fire crews tackling a blaze .

1568,"The mother-of-three who dropped her two-year-old son into a cheetah pit is the assistant director of a childcare center. Michelle Schwab, who has three sons and a degree in therapeutic childcare, has been charged with child endangerment after  she allegedly dangled her child over the 10-foot-deep enclosure in Cleveland Metroparks Zoo before he slipped and fell. She faces six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Visitors heard a scream at 3pm on Saturday and looked to see Schwab, 38, and her husband leaping into the pit to retrieve the child, who was treated for a leg injury. On Monday, a spokesman for KinderCare, a nationally-acclaimed education, care and resource provider, confirmed Schwab has taken a leave of absence from her management role at one of the centers in Columbus, Ohio. Scroll down for video . Charged: Michelle Schwab, a mother-of-three with a degree in therapeutic childcare, has been charged with child endangerment for allegedly dangling her son of a cheetah pit. She is an assistant director at KinderCare . Witnesses say Schwab jumped in to retrieve the boy from the compound at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo at 3pm on Saturday. The animals appeared to ignore the boy, witnesses say (file image of one of the zoo's cheetahs) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . In an email to DailyMail.com, spokesman Colleen Moran said: 'We were saddened to hear of Saturday’s incident at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo involving Michelle Schwab’s son, and we wish him a speedy recovery. 'Ms Schwab has been the Assistant Director at the Sawmill Road KinderCare in Columbus. She is currently home with her family, and will remain out of our center while this issue is investigated and addressed. 'In addition to the agencies looking into this issue, we are looking into the incident further ourselves, as we closely examine issues involving the treatment of children by our employees, even if those incidents arise outside of our centers.' Schwab, of Delaware, Ohio, was charged on Monday in Cleveland Municipal Court and will be arraigned on April 22. On Sunday, Dr Christopher Kuhar, executive director at the zoo, said the two felines did not approach the boy when he fell in the pit. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' The exhibit was closed following the child's fall. Zoo visitor Michael Lurie was at the cheetah exhibit when he heard the child scream.

2930,"Whistleblower Julian Asssange has added insult to injury for Sony Pictures after his website Wikileaks put hundreds of thousands of emails and documents from last year's cyberattack into a searchable online archive. The calculated move by Assange to expose thousands of indiscreet and personal correspondences will likely spell fresh embarrassment for the embattled company so soon after they hoped the dust had settled on the matter. Assange and Wikileaks issued a statement on Thursday saying that the data has a public interest, but the majority of the correspondences run from the mundane to the deeply personal. They expose not just the unguarded opinions of Sony executives, but also reveal health concerns about their children and sadness over dying parents. Scroll down for video . Adding insult to injury: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange (pictured here speaking via video link at the Commonwealth Law Conference in Glasgow on Wednesday) has said that the information leaked belongs online because it shows the inner workings of an international company . Sticking the knife in: Julian Assange has defended collating the Sony hack into one searchable database saying that the entertainment giant has links to the Democratic party and the American 'military industrial complex' The data dump today comes after November's massive hack which has already cost the entertainment giant upwards of $100 million. Wikileaks claim they built a database from the 170,000 emails and 30,000 other documents stolen from Sony Pictures by a group calling itself Guardians of Peace. The group hacked Sony Pictures in retaliation for the Kim-Jong-un assassination film, The Interview, starring Seth Rogen. Assange's decision to put the data up in a searchable form could be seen as particularly cruel coming so soon after Sony had finished dealing with the fall-out from the damaging affair. A picture says 1000 words: Angelina Jolie stares down Amy Pascal at The Hollywood Reporter Women in Entertainment Power 100 Breakfast on December 10, 2014 - just days after leaked Sony emails between her and  Scott Rudin (right with Pascal) revealed Jolie to be described as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' Resignation: The embarrassing revelations exposed by the hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment led to CEO Amy Pascal (pictured with Aaron Sorkin) leaving the company . 'The cyber-attack on Sony Pictures was a malicious criminal act, and we strongly condemn the indexing of stolen employee and other private and privileged information on WikiLeaks,' a Sony spokesperson said in a statement to Variety. 'The attackers used the dissemination of stolen information to try to harm SPE and its employees, and now WikiLeaks regrettably is assisting them in that effort. ' In a statement, Assange said the documents deserve to be easily accessible. 'This archive shows the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation. It is newsworthy and at the centre of a geopolitical conflict. It belongs in the public domain. WikiLeaks will ensure it stays there.' Wikileaks also claim that the documents show Sony's close ties to the Democratic Party and its efforts to collect 'intelligence' on rival studios - including ironically, Oliver Stone's new film on NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden. 'The work publicly known from Sony is to produce entertainment,' Wikileaks wrote in their statement issued on Thursday. 'However, the Sony Archives show that behind the scenes this is an influential corporation, with ties to the White House, with an ability to impact laws and policies, and with connections to the US military-industrial complex.' The WikiLeaks site lets users find emails, documents or an entire cache of files through searches using keywords, people who sent or received emails and types of files. The site made a name for itself in 2010 when it began publishing diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Bradley Manning. Cause of the woes: The Interview, a comedy about two journalists - James Franco and Seth Rogen - was widely seen as the reason why Sony was attacked by cyber-hackers affiliated with North Korea . Assange is currently battling a detention order in Sweden, where he is wanted by prosecutors in an investigation of alleged sex crimes. He has avoided being extradited to Sweden by taking shelter in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012. Sony Pictures blasted WikiLeaks for creating the archive, saying the website was helping the hackers disseminate stolen information. 'We vehemently disagree with WikiLeaks' assertion that this material belongs in the public domain,' the company said in a statement. The searchable online archive is the latest blow for the entertainment and technology company struggling to get past the attack, which the company estimates caused millions in damage. Sony Pictures' troubles began last December after it suffered an extensive hacking attack and release of confidential emails ahead of its release of 'The Interview,' a comedy that centers around the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Canceled: Following the cyber hack, Sony Pictures pulled The Interview from general release and ended up releasing the movie online only . Guardians of the Peace took credit for the attack and threatened terror attacks if the film was not pulled from theaters. The company at first shelved the film, but it subsequently opened in a limited release. U.S. intelligence officials said the group was linked to North Korea, but no official link has been made. The attack exposed tens of thousands of sensitive documents, including studio financial records, employment files and emails between Sony executives. Some emails revealed exchanges between Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures' co-chair Amy Pascal that contained a frank assessment of Angelina Jolie's talent and racially offensive jokes about President Barack Obama's presumed taste in movies. Indeed, an email from studio executive Clint Culpepper labeled comedian Kevin Hart a 'whore' and producer Scott Rudin called Angelina Jolie, a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. The scandal led to the resignation of  Pascal. 'The content of my emails to Scott were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am,' Pascal wrote in a public apology. 'Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.' Recent hit: Amy Pascal with the stars of Sony comedy, The Wedding Ringer, from left, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, Josh Gad and Kevin Hart at the premiere in LA on January 6 . The company announced in February that Pascal would transition to a job as the head of a new production venture at the studio. Rudin also published an apology, saying: 'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive — and not funny at all. To anybody I've offended, I'm profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.' Wikileaks claim they have found correspondence which exposes Sony's political fundraising and lobbying for anti-piracy. They point to emails which detail how members of the studio set up a 'collective' to get around campaign donation limits and made contributions to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Wikileaks justified their move by pointing to lobbying issues they have found in the leaks. 'Sony is a member of the MPAA and a strong lobbyist on issues around internet policy, piracy, trade agreements and copyright issues,' their press release claimed. 'The emails show the back and forth on lobbying and political efforts, not only with the MPAA but with politicians directly.'","WikiLeaks uploads hundreds of thousands of emails and documents into a searchable online archive .

The Chelsea star reached 100 Premier League appearances for the Blues at QPR on Sunday and has been lauded for his fine performances for Jose Mourinho’s side this season. Sky Sports pundit Souness believes Hazard, who has 35 goals and 25 assists in his century of Premier League games, will be named the PFA Player of the Year. Eden Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March . ‘He’s got dancing feet hasn’t he? When he runs with the ball it’s never more than nine inches away from his feet,’ Souness told Sky Sports. ‘So if you’re a defender, the minute you stick out a foot, he’s skipped past you,’ added Souness. ‘He’s got great feet and looks to be a strong boy too. If you look at him he’s all there, if he wants to stand up to challenges he definitely can.’ Having grown into an integral part of Chelsea’s attack, Souness compares the rapid Belgian with leading world stars such as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Hazard warms up at Loftus Road ahead of the clash with QPR, his 100th Premier League game for Chelsea . Jose Mourinho believes that 'it shouldn't even be a debate' that Hazard should claim PFA Player of the Year . ‘The way he goes past players, he makes good players look ordinary. He’s a bit like Messi and Ronaldo in that when you see them go past people, you think “that’s bad defending”, but no it’s not not. These guys are just that good and Hazard is close to that category.’ ‘He certainly needs more goals for me but he’s one of the few players that gets you on the edge of your seat every time you watch him play,’ added Souness. ‘I still think there is much more to come from him in the future.’ Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge .","Chelsea star Eden Hazard made his 100th top-flight appearance at QPR .

One-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan is on hunger strike for the second time in a bid to be moved to a secure psychiatric hospital. The 31-year-old was reportedly transferred to solitary confinement in HMP Manchester, formerly Strangeways, a month ago after being caught smuggling a mobile phone and cannabis into his prison cell, sources said. But in a desperate attempt to get himself moved Cregan, who was jailed for life after shooting police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in 2012, has apparently stopped eating. He is hoping to be transferred from the Category A prison to Ashworth Hospital, a high-security psychiatric unit in Maghull, Merseyside, the Daily Star Sunday reported. Before the fallout sources told the Star that Cregan had an enhanced status and was allowed additional time in the games area and yard, as well as a flat-screen TV and DVD player in his room. But the benefits were taken off him after he was caught smuggling for a second time. 'Cregan has burned all his bridges in here,' the source said. 'He has not eaten since he was sent into segregation. That is 30 days of not eating.' Ashworth hospital offers comfortable bedrooms and patients are allowed personal items such as CDs, photos and books. Art and music workshops, pottery and cooking classes, and social events such as bingo and film nights are also offered to the patients. Cregan went on the run in 2012 after murdering David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23, in a bar fight. The killer, who lost an eye in a separate brawl, lured officers Bone and Hughes into his house four months later with a fake 999 call.

10776,"A former Premier League footballer 'cast his net around' for players willing to take part in a plot to fix lower league matches, a court has heard. Ex-Bolton Wanderers striker Delroy Facey, 34, is alleged to have become involved in the 'ugly side' of his sport by acting as a middleman for two men who have already been convicted of match-fixing. Facey, who also played for West Bromwich Albion and Hull City, denies conspiracy to commit bribery and is standing trial at Birmingham Crown Court alongside former non-league player Moses Swaibu, who also denies the charges. Delroy Facey (right) arrives at Birmingham Crown Court for the start of his trial on Monday. He is accused of being involved in a plot to fix lower league football matches . Facey (right) celebrates after scoring for Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League in 2003 . Opening the Crown's case against both Facey and Swaibu at the start of a three-week trial, prosecutor Nick Mather told jurors they would not need to know anything about football to try the defendants. Mr Mather told the jury panel: 'Football in this case is really nothing more than a means to an end - it's an opportunity to make money. 'It's described sometimes as the beautiful game but football has an ugly side to it as well, and it's that ugly side we are going to be looking at.' After explaining to jurors that match-fixers Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan were found guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery at a previous trial, Mr Mather alleged that Swaibu was one of the players they had tried to corrupt. Sankaran and Ganeshan, both from the Far East, were at the centre of the conspiracy, the court heard, having travelled to Britain with the specific purpose of fixing matches. Defendant Moses Swaibu (right) on the ball during an FA Cup match between Lincoln and Bolton in 2010 . The Crown alleges that the plot - which aimed to profit from rigged bets - targeted the lower leagues because of the high level of scrutiny surrounding the Premier League. Swaibu played at a semi-professional level between 2009 and 2014, including stints with London-based Sutton FC and Brighton club Whitehawk. Jurors were also given details of Facey's career, which included a spell at Lincoln City in which he earned around £65,000 during the 2010/11 season. Describing Facey's alleged role in the conspiracy, Mr Mather added: 'He was a middleman, a fixer. He was somebody who cast his net around to find players who might be willing to take part in match-fixing.' By the time of the alleged conspiracy in November 2013, Mr Mather told the court, Facey was earning considerably less than previously. 'That may well have been his motivation, the prosecution say, for what took place,' Mr Mather said of Facey's reduced income. Facey (top) in action for West Brom during a match against Norwich City in March 2004 . Informing jurors that another footballer, former Whitehawk FC defender Michael Boateng, was also found guilty at a previous trial, Mr Mather said there was no doubt that an agreement to fix lower league matches occurred. 'This case is not about whether this scheme existed,' the prosecutor told the jury. 'The issue for you to decide is whether you are sure that firstly, Delroy Facey, and secondly Moses Swaibu, was a part of that agreement. 'This case is focused on them and what they did, and why they did it.' Facey, from Woodhouse Hill, Huddersfield, and 25-year-old Swaibu, of Tooley Street, Bermondsey, south London, deny conspiring together with others to commit bribery between November 1 and 27, 2013. Mr Mather said betting on football was not confined to the Premier League and extended from the very top of the sport down to semi-professional leagues. Lower league games in the Football Conference had been targeted, Mr Mather claimed, partly because highly-paid professionals would have to be offered 'astronomical' sums to even think about becoming involved in corruption. Huddersfield's Facey (left) vies with Brentford's Michael Dobson during an old Second Division match in 2002 . The conspiracy came to the attention of the National Crime Agency after initial inquiries by a private investigator who wanted to expose match-fixing led to the identification of Sankaran. A national newspaper then became involved, the court was told, and Sankaran arrived in the UK in November 2013. During a meeting with an undercover investigator on November 16, Sankaran is alleged to have made unsuccessful attempts to contact footballers and made reference to an agent named Delroy who used to play for Bolton. At that point, the court heard, the National Crime Agency took over the investigation, deploying a covert officer to gather evidence. The officer met Sankaran five days later and mobile phones belonging to the defendants, including Facey, were subsequently seized. Mr Mather will continue his opening speech to the jury on Tuesday.

5101,"A sign of Raheem Sterling’s tender years can be seen inked into his forearm. The image of Wembley, which overlooked his estate growing up, is clear amid a cluster of tattoos. Rather than those two famous towers, synonymous with the national stadium for 77 years, it is the arc, unveiled in 2007, that is unmistakable. Back then, Sterling was a young kid dreaming of a career in professional football, playing jumpers for goalposts on streets and in parks. Raheem Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer .

He is still just 20, but much has changed. Sterling is now in position to reject contract offers of £100,000 per week from Liverpool, confident enough to express his views to the BBC without the knowledge of his club. ‘I don't want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old,’ says the player aware of his value as much as his age and how those two factors are linked. He knows, with two years left on his £35,000-per-week deal, he holds the cards in discussions with one of the biggest clubs in English and European football. It has been quite a remarkable rise for Sterling since his days looking up at Wembley with hope in his heart and a ball under his arm; rapidly progressing along the ground and through the ranks.

Neil Ashton broke the Sterling contract story on Monday - CLICK HERE TO READ FULL ARTICLE . He was born in Maverley, Kingston, a tough Jamaican community where gun crime is rife and drug gangs rule, before moving across the Atlantic aged five to join his mother Nadine in north London along with three siblings. Living on the St Raphael’s estate meant the sounds of gunshots were never far away. Police labelled the adjoining Stonebridge estate a warzone in 2005. Rival gangs engaged in tit-for-tat shootings. ‘They were all dealing in crack cocaine and it was a fight for territory,’ said Detective Inspector Stephen Horsley in 2009. Sterling had his football and his mother, a source of inspiration and guidance. But he failed to settle in a mainstream primary school because of behavioural problems, finding escape at the Vernon House Special School, which he attended for three years. A decade ago he began to take his sport seriously. The English youngster spent seven years at Queens Park Rangers before moving to Liverpool in 2010 . He joined QPR's Centre of Excellence aged 11, and within three years was starring for the Under 18s . He joined Queens Park Rangers’ Centre of Excellence aged 11, and within three years was starring for the Under 18s. Mark Anderson and Frank McParland, Liverpool’s youth scout and academy director respectively, spotted Sterling star in these games and began their pursuit. At this time Sterling was taken under the wing of Tom Walley, a veteran youth coach who has worked with Ashley Cole and David James. Sterling’s pay has rocketed since he left QPR, where he would have been earning around £400 per week. After his move north, his first pro contract at Liverpool was worth £2,000 per week and his current deal earns him £35,000 per week as previously mentioned. Michael Calvin details in his book, The Nowhere Men, how Sterling would take part in pick-up games organised by Walley on a pitch in the back garden of the home of Tim Sherwood, then Tottenham’s technical co-ordinator. NEIL ASHTON: Just after 6pm most weekdays, Christian Nanetti counts his tips and rushes out the door of the new Soho eaterie Estado. Nanetti is a waiter now, blending into the London crowds as he heads for the Tube station to make his way out to Ashford, Kent, to train with his new club Dover Athletic.

Calvin writes that Spurs turned down the chance to sign Sterling for £200,000 because academy coaches were in disagreement over his long-term potential. Fulham were assured of his talent and had Sterling in their building before Liverpool swooped to take him to Merseyside aged 15 for £500,000. Shortly before travelling north, Sterling took part in Soccer Am’s Skill School challenge, facing another promising youngster Christain Nanetti. He is most recently of Dover Athletic, a tale of just how tough it is to make the kind of ascent Sterling has managed. He is close to completing his third full season as a Liverpool first-teamer having become the club’s second-youngest debutant aged 17 years and 107 days.

Rodgers points in the direction of Sterling during following a pre-season training session in 2012 . Both youthful and experienced, Sterling won the first of 14 England caps in November 2012. That call-up came three months after Brendan Rodgers admonished his player for uttering the word ‘steady’ during a pre-season training debrief. ‘You say steady to me again when I say something to you, you’ll be on the first plane back,’ said a pointing Rodgers in remarkably candid footage captured for Fox documentary Being: Liverpool.

Another of Sterling’s tattoos is the face and name of his daughter, Melody Rose, born in 2012 following a brief relationship.

1704,"(CNN)Australia has recalled its ambassador to Indonesia for consultations after two Australians were among eight drug smugglers executed by firing squad early Wednesday. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called the executions ""cruel and unnecessary"" because both men, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, had been ""fully rehabilitated"" during a decade in prison. Abbott didn't say what permanent actions, if any, would be taken against Indonesia. ""This is a dark moment in the relationship, but I'm sure the relationship will be restored,"" he said. One of the men's Indonesian lawyers, Todung Mulya Lubis tweeted his apologies. ""I failed. I lost,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."" Indonesian President Joko Widodo appeared to shrug off the diplomatic recall, telling reporters that ""our legal sovereignty must be respected. We also respect other countries' legal sovereignty."" Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the country had no plans to recall its own ambassador in response. ""This is a legal case. This is not a political case so at this very stage, we do not have any plan to call our ambassador back from Canberra,"" he said. Six other inmates were executed, including Nigerians Raheem Salami, Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Okwudil Oyatanze and Martin Anderson; Indonesian Zainal Abidin and Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte, who was said to be mentally ill. On Wednesday, Brazil's foreign ministry released a statement expressing ""deep sadness"" at Gularte's execution, saying that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff had urged her Indonesian counterpart to spare him due to his ""psychiatric condition."" Gularte is the second Brazilian to be executed in Indonesia this year, with the first -- Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira -- prompting the country to recall its ambassador for consultations. The Indonesian government had originally announced that nine prisoners would be executed, but at the last moment Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was spared. ""We are so happy, so happy. I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good. Thank you to everyone who helped us,"" her mother Celia Veloso told CNN. Philippines embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday. No reason was given for the reprieve but it may relate to developments in her case late on Tuesday. CNN Philippines reported that Veloso's alleged recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio and her partner Julius Lacanilao, surrendered to authorities. The report said Sergio had denied all accusations in relation to Veloso's case. Veloso's lawyers claimed the mother-of-two was the victim of human trafficking. They say she was offered work in Malaysia, but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and wasn't aware the bag she'd been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs. A tenth prisoner, Frenchman Serge Atlaoui, was also scheduled to be executed but his case was delayed while a court considers a legal challenge. Candlelight vigils were held for Chan and Sukumaran in the hours ahead of the expected execution. The men's legal teams had been fighting for years for a stay, but it wasn't to be. The men -- then aged in their early twenties -- were arrested in 2005 as part of the ""Bali Nine,"" a drug smuggling gang that intended to import 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of heroin from Bali to Australia. They failed. The pair were transported with other prisoners to Indonesia's so-called ""execution island"" in March, and after being given 72-hours notice of their execution on Saturday, Chan married his longtime girlfriend, Febyanti Herewila, on Monday in prison. The executions of Sukumaran and Chan came despite the fact that both this week received a court date of May 12 to hear an outstanding legal challenge. On Tuesday, lawyers for the men also said Indonesia's Judicial Commission had yet to properly investigate claims of corruption during their original trial and sentencing. They said three of the men's Indonesian lawyers had been summoned to attend the commission on May 7. However, before the executions, Indonesia insisted that all legal avenues had closed. On Tuesday, the prisoners' families were heard wailing as they boarded a boat for the execution site. Visiting hours were extended until 8 p.m. to give them extra time before they were asked to leave. Under Indonesian law, the death penalty is carried out by a 12-man firing squad, although only three guns are loaded with live ammunition. Prisoners are given the choice of whether to stand or sit, and whether they want to wear a blindfold, hood or nothing. The shots -- aimed at the heart -- are fired from between 5 and 10 meters (16 to 33 feet), according to Amnesty International. After the executions, the rights group released a statement condemning them as ""reprehensible"" and issue fresh calls for a moratorium on the death penalty. While the Bali Nine have garnered much international attention, their punishment is part of a larger government effort to combat illegal drug trafficking. Indonesian President Widodo has insisted that Indonesia would not be swayed by appeals for clemency because the country is dealing with a ""drugs crisis."" He told CNN in January that clemency would not be extended to drug traffickers, leading to an appeal from Chan and Sukumaran that their cases hadn't been properly considered. Lawyers for the two men said they underwent radical rehabilitation during their 10 years in Kerobokan prison and were helping to counsel and support other inmates. Chan was ordained as a Christian minister who led prayer meetings, while Sukumaran became an accomplished painter and established his own art classes inside the Bali prison. The Indonesian government didn't confirm until late Tuesday that the executions were to go ahead. Preparations were clearly underway earlier that day, with the arrival of ambulances at the port where boats leave to go to Nusa Kambangan island where the prisoners were being held. Images showed individual crosses bearing the prisoners' names and the date April 29, 2015. Families were in little doubt as to what lay ahead. When reports of his death emerged, Sukumaran's cousin tweeted: ""I love you more than you can imagine. Your legacy will live on. I promise. Save me a place in heaven."" CNN's Tasha Tampubolon contributed to this report.","Brazil extends 'deepest sympathy' to family of executed Brazilian .

10201,"Some of the oldest surviving photographs of the Houses of Parliament and Windsor Castle, dating back more than 150 years, have been found. The remarkable images were shot by photographer Victor Albert Prout, who developed the negatives in an improvised dark room on board his punt which he sailed along the River Thames. And despite being more than 150 years old, most of the images capturing the iconic landmarks along the river are instantly recognisable today. Scroll down for video . Prout travelled along the River Thames in a makeshift boat where he installed a dark room (centre, front), capturing and developing his images on site, like this one of Windsor Castle (top right) Prout's collection is the oldest documented record of Britain's best known landmarks, such as Windsor Castle, seen from the banks today . A photo of taken of Richmond Bridge shows the familiar arches of the 18th century stonework, clearly recognisable today. While a picture taken from the banks of the Thames of Windsor Castle, showing Prout's floating dark room in the foreground, is remarkably similar to contemporary pictures of the iconic building. Another shows the Houses of Parliament in the 1850s when Henry John Temple The Viscount Palmerston was Prime Minister, and is strikingly similar to photos taken today. The pictures are to be sold as a collection at the Oxford Book Fair and are estimated to sell for around £30,000. Prout travelled around the Thames on his boat to capture images of the well known landmarks, developing them on the spot His floating dark room construction is often seen tethered to a skiff in some of the photographs. As an artist and photographer was renowned for his panoramic pictures, captured along the stretch of the River Thames - featuring images from the Houses of Parliament to Magdalen Bridge in Oxford. He was commissioned to take the collection of pictures for The Book of the Thames: From Its Rise to its Fall, by Mr and Mrs S.G. Hall. The photographer was known for his panoramic images, such as this one taken overlooking the River Thames, of Richmond Bridge . Richmond Bridge today is busier than the scene surrounding the 18th century stone bridge captured by Prout around 150 years ago . The buildings and riverside of Marlow was captured in a photograph taken by Prout, who then developed his pictures as quickly as he could . Today's picture of Marlow - with the church spire dominating - bears a striking resemblance to that taken by Proust, more than 150 years ago . The images, such as this of Iffley Mill, were saved by Prout in his book of pictures of the Thames in the mid 1850s and will now be auctioned . Some of the photos capture how the areas have changed, such as at Iffley where the watermill no longer stands after it was burned to the ground in 1908, having survived for almost 800 years . Prout's photography along the River Thames included this shot of Twickenham in the 1950s, with his darkroom boat in the foreground (right) Twickenham has been significantly developed since the 1850s when Prout captured his image of the London suburb along the Thames . The photos - believed to be the the first documented collection of the UK's greatest river - were eventually published by Prout's father's publishing company, Virtue and Co, in around 1862. Only a handful of copies of the photographs are known to exist, with most in specialist collections. The last to appear at auction was at Sothebys in 1981. Each of the photographs captured a historical record of the area at the time -  with some also showing how changes have occurred in the last 150 years. At Iffley, a watermill built during the 12th century, was a focal part of Prout's image. But in photos from today the mill is absent - after it was burned to the ground in the early 1900s. Prout's image provides a historical record of the construct, which produced malt, barley and corn for almost 800 years. But most of the photos show how little things have changed - such as the photos of the Houses of Parliament and Marlow Lock. An image of the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Bridge, taken by Victor Albert Prout, is believed to be one of the oldest photographs . Prout's picture of the Houses of Parliament is thought to be the oldest surviving image of the landmark, which looks similar today . A black and white photograph of Hampton Court features in Prout's groundbreaking photo album of panoramic views of the River Thames . Hampton Court is in full view overlooking the River Thames in an image taken from the exact same spot today as the one several years ago . The images capture how London's landmarks appeared in the nineteenth century, such as at Great Marlow Lock, as he travelled past . Marlow lock and weir lies on the River Thames today after being built in 1773 and captured by Prout almost 100 years later . The collection will be sold by Antiquates Ltd - Fine and Rare Books, at the Oxford book fair, held on April 25 and 26, for £28,500. Last month an image taken by Prout of young men playing cricket at Eton was discovered and at 150 years old, was believed to be the earliest ever photograph of a school cricket match, and the second oldest of any cricket anywhere. The image, which showed men playing in waistcoats, was signed in pencil by Prout and taken just five years after the first ever image illustrating the sport. This was captured by Roger Fenton in 1857, a founding member of the Royal Photographic Society and famous for his photographs of the Crimean War. Prout's photo captures the calmness at Wallingford Bridge - which connected Wallingford with Crowmarsh Gifford in Oxfordshire . Today Wallingford Bridge is still a calm stretch of waterway on the River Thames, with most traffic now crossing Winterbrook Bridge instead . Snapshots in the collection, including this of barges in Oxford, will be sold when it is sold at the Oxford Book Fair for around £30,000 . The busy waterways in Oxford, pictured in 2009, bear a striking resemblance to the bustling river captured by Prout 150 years earlier . The incredibly rare collection of photographs taken from London to Oxford is to be sold and has an estimated value of about £30,000 .","Victor Prout created a makeshift dark room on board a boat he used to travel along stretch of the River Thames .

10072,"(CNN)If that was a tornado, it was one monster of one. Luckily, so far it looks like no one was hurt. With tornadoes touching down near Dallas on Sunday, Ryan Shepard snapped a photo of a black cloud formation reaching down to the ground. He said it was a tornado. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it looked half a mile wide. More like a mile, said Jamie Moore, head of emergency management in Johnson County, Texas. It could have been one the National Weather Service warned about in a tweet as severe thunderstorms drenched the area, causing street flooding. ""To repeat--tornadoes (yes, two) likely W and E of Rio Vista. The one to the E of Rio Vista is a large, damaging tornado,"" the NWS tweeted.

5806,"(CNN)Laying down tracks for their debut album in the recording studio in Los Angeles, Iman Hashi, 25 and her sister Siham, 27 could not be further from their hometown of Mogadishu. The sisters were born in the Somali capital but were forced to flee after war broke out in 1991. Along with their parents, the girls relocated to Canada as refugees where during their teens they discovered a passion for music. Heading south to LA by way of Atlanta, the singing sisters with a bold flair for fashion are now embarking on a musical journey, gearing up to unleash their Afro-pop sound to the world. CNN's African Voices caught up with the sister act -- known collectively as Faarrow (combining the translation of their names into English -- Iman means ""Faith"" and Siham means ""Arrow"") to talk about music, aspirations and Somalia. CNN: Hi guys, thanks for chatting with me today. What are some of your musical influences? Iman: We love Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie -- stuff my mom would listen to and play -- and the Spice Girls. We used to die for the Spice Girls. I love new artists now but I don't know if it's a nostalgia, but I remember ... my mom used to pump whatever -- Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston. CNN: You are working on your debut album now -- how's that been? Siham: We've been working with Elijah Kelley -- he's actually an actor. He was in ""Hairspray,"" ""The Butler,"" and most recently he was in the George Lucas animation, ""Strange Magic."" That's what he's more known for but his first passion is music. He's an incredible producer, writer and singer. I just felt like he was always the missing piece. He brought everything together. CNN: So now that you've found your ""missing piece,"" how would you describe your sound? Siham: Our music before was experimenting with Afrobeat sounds but now it's more of a fusion (of what) we are inspired by. It's pop with undertones of hip hop and rhythmic African percussion. It's a fusion of everything. CNN: And do you guys write the songs as well? Siham: The entire album was pretty much (written and produced) by me, my sister and Elijah. And when we signed we already had a lot of those songs already done. Warner Brothers Records is really great in that way that they already loved what we were doing and let us do our own thing. CNN: What are you listening to right now? Siham: Oh my God, there's so many! Iman: Sia with ""Chandelier."" Siham: I really love this new song -- I don't know if Iman is going to agree with me -- but his name's LunchMoney Lewis, it's called Bills; I love it. CNN: As well as your music, you both work with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- how did you start your humanitarian work? Iman: Ever since we were kids we wanted to help Somalia, we always talked about it. But we were like ""what can we physically do?"" We were doing some research and we called our mom and she said 'You know you still have family over there. There's a refugee camp in Kenya and your great uncle and his kids live in a refugee camp.' And we did some research about Dadaab refugee camp, it's a massive camp that has taken in Sudanese refugees, Somali refugees, Rwandan refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict. Everybody fled to Dadaab. In the beginning (it was) pure advocacy talking about it on Twitter and Facebook. CNN: But then you decided to ""up your game"" as it were... Iman: Yes, then we started a non-profit and we'd do small benefit concerts in Toronto and in San Diego -- wherever there was a big Somali community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing, working with UNHCR in a capacity as a spokesperson. We headlined World Refugee Day at the Kennedy Center, as well as the Nansen Awards twice in Geneva. We felt like this platform of singing -- the bigger it gets, the more we can do. Siham: We obviously love fashion so we wanted to do our own socially conscious brand so we've been making these bracelets and necklaces called ""Wish Creatively."" Wish stands for ""Women Internationally Selling Hope."" We wanted to do a socially conscious brand where we sell these bracelets where it goes back to projects in Kenya or Somalia with women providing them with a sustainable income. CNN: So what's next for you two? Siham: We're actually in the mixing process right now. We still have a few (tracks) to finish up but the majority of the album is pretty much done. We want to turn it in as soon as possible so they can put together a rollout plan and get ready for the first single to drop. Iman: I don't feel like we ever lost that feeling like we're creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for Somalia. I feel like now because we followed our dreams it's like 'they're not just refugees anymore.' We don't have to become doctors so we can one day give back to Somalia and help rebuild -- it's such a beautiful dream but not ours. In our culture, anything creative is not really respected or appreciated. But I feel like now but even with our new deal we're still trucking along. I feel like we inspire people.

3657,"Sir Bruce Forsyth has spoken out in favour of assisted dying, saying that watching his first wife suffer with dementia has convinced him he wants to 'die with a bit of dignity left'. The veteran entertainer, now 87, said people should not be 'left to suffer', adding that in many cases it could be 'more cruel to do nothing' than allowing them to die. Sir Bruce's first wife, Penny Calvert, was moved into a care home with dementia in 2008, and he visited regularly to help care for her until her death last year. Scroll down for video . Sir Bruce Forsyth has said that sometimes it can be 'more cruel to do nothing' than to let someone die, as he spoke out today in support of assisted dying . Sir Bruce said his experience of nursing first wife Penny Calvert (pictured here with the couple's three children) as she suffered with dementia had convinced him of a need for a change in the law . He said: 'It's a terrible illness, awful to see and awful for everyone close to the person suffering. 'It’s a very difficult situation. She didn’t remember me. It’s just so awful to have your mind and your memories taken away from you. 'It bothers me an awful lot that people are just left to suffer. If I had Alzheimer’s or dementia I would do something about it. 'The law should be changed and if people want to die with a bit of dignity left they should be able to do so. 'If it is what the person wants and it can be proved they are living a life of suffering it can be more cruel to do nothing. I’d like that right for myself.' Sir Bruce married Ms Calvert in 1953, and the couple had three children together before splitting 20 years later. He then went on to marry Anthea Redfern, the hostess on the Generation Game, followed by Wilnelia Merced, a former Miss World who he married in 1983. While Sir Bruce (left) separated from Ms Calvert (right) in 1973, the two remained in contact, and he helped to secretly nurse her after she was taken into a home in 2008, until she died last year . Sir Bruce (pictured left with third and current wife Wilnelia Merced, and right after receiving his knighthood) said he would like the right to be able to end his life 'with a bit of dignity left' Despite these new relationships, he remained on good terms with Ms Calvert, and supported her through her illness. Sir Bruce joins other celebrities and politicians who support assisted dying, including the late author Terry Pratchett, former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey, and Labour peer Lord Falconer. The latter has already tabled a bill asking that patients with less than six months to live be allowed to take their own life with the help of a doctor. However, the proposed change in the law has proved controversial, with distinguished judge Baroness Butler-Sloss saying it would 'cross a line' towards euthanasia. Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have also spoken out against assisted dying in the past. Under the 1961 Suicide Act, those who deliberate assist or encourage others to commit suicide can be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison. However, in 2010, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, issued guidelines making clear that anyone who assists a loved one who has reached a 'settled and informed' decision while 'acting out of compassion' is unlikely to be charged, leading to ambiguity.","Sir Bruce said it can be 'more cruel to do nothing' than to let someone die .

1093,"Ben Affleck is apologizing after it came to light that the Academy Award-winning actor and director asked that information be withheld from a PBS show about his family history. After appearing on Finding Your Roots and learning one of his ancestors was a slave owner, Affleck pushed the network to leave that information out of the program it was first revealed by DailyMail.com, a request the producers ultimately agreed to. This enabled Affleck to hide the identity of his ancestor, named today by The Sun as James McGuire, who kept eight slaves on his farm in Trenton in New Jersey in the 1840s. Today the actor apologized for asking producers to leave out the name in a post on Facebook, while also explaining his reasons for his decision. Scroll down for video . Ben Affleck has apologized after he demanded information about a slave-owning relative be withheld from a PBS show about his ancestry . Affleck took to Facebook to issue his apology . 'After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for Finding Your Roots, it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves,' wrote Affleck. 'I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.' Affleck went on to say he lobbied for that information to be withheld after filming the episode. 'It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable,' he explained. 'The assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family.' He then added; 'I regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story. We deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are, as a nation, still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery. It is an examination well worth continuing.' US genealogist Debra Fleming is said to have helped trace Affleck's family tree back to McGuire, a relative of his father Timothy. Ms Fleming told the Sun: 'There are lots of farmers in the family. Slavery didn't end in New Jersey until 1846.' Affleck is just one of the many celebrities once again under fire after WikiLeaks sorted all the hacked Sony emails into a system that makes them easier for the public to search. PBS meanwhile is conducting an internal investigation to determine if this omission violated the network's editorial standards. They have yet to release a statement on their findings. After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for ""Finding Your Roots,"" it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves. I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth. Skip decided what went into the show. I lobbied him the same way I lobby directors about what takes of mine I think they should use. This is the collaborative creative process. Skip agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with. In the end, it's his show and I knew that going in. I'm proud to be his friend and proud to have participated. It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable.

2731,"A man who has two failed marriages with Gambian women is hoping it will be third time lucky now that he is engaged to another woman he met in the country that he now calls home. David Tungate, 58, was left devastated after the marriage to his first Gambian wife broke down shortly after he brought her to the UK. He then remarried, but his second wife, also from Gambia, turned out to be a serial bigamist who conned him out of £24,000 of his retirement money and left him close to bankruptcy. David Tungate with his fiancee Isatou Jarju . Determined not to let the experiences put him off, David is now dating a third Gambian woman and is convinced his latest lady will prove to be third time lucky. The former van driver said: 'I know people reading this might think I'm the most gullible man in Britain but I'm not bothered. 'I may have been left with nothing from the last Gambian woman I fell in love with, but my new girlfriend is different. 'She is wonderful and I feel blessed. It may be stupid but I always follow my heart.' David with his last wide Ndey, who was a bigamist . After divorcing his British wife of seven years in 1992, the father-of-two never imagined he would find love again. With the help of his sons from his first marriage, David slowly overcame the heartbreak and put his life back together. It wasn't until 1998 when he visited Gambia on holiday that he fell in love with Nyima Sye. Converting to Islam and marrying her that year, David brought his beautiful new wife back to the UK but five years later their marriage ended and the pair divorced. David said: 'Nyima was too young for me and eventually the cultural differences tore us apart. 'We split amicably but looking back now, she could have been after me for a British passport. I would never bring another Gambian woman over to the UK because of that.' David swore off women but 15 years later, everything changed when he joined a friend on another holiday to the West African country. Just a few days into his stay, David met Ndey, then 22, a waitress who could speak good English. Ndey in the town centre close to her home in Gambia . The pair started talking and after she explained she was recovering from Malaria and had lost her job in the restaurant, he offered to help. David started sending her £50 a week and even paid a cafe owner to give his new love a job, bank rolling her wages of £30 a week, unbeknownst to Ndey. Finally in June 2011 David had saved up enough money from his job as a van driver to fly back out to Gambia to be with his love. He said: 'I booked another two-week holiday and packed my suitcase full of clothes and jewellery for Ndey. 'I couldn't wait to start our relationship and when I got there and she met me at the airport, it was more than I had ever dreamed of. 'Leaving her to go back to the UK was heart breaking, I was already counting down the days until I could come back and see her.' In October 2012, 16 months later, David flew out to Bakau in Gambia with yet another suitcase of expensive gifts for his girlfriend. As well as securing a date for their wedding, David rented a flat out for her so they would have somewhere to stay whenever he returned to the country. In June 2013, the pair wed at Kanising Islamic Court in front of Ndey's sister and uncle - sadly none of David's family made the trip for the wedding. David with Ndey, who became pregnant with another man while they were married . Returning to see his wife as often as he could afford, David planned to stay living in the UK until he retired from his job as a newspaper delivery driver. In February 2014, Ndey asked him if he could pay the £60 a month lease on a fashion shop she planned to open, which he agreed to do. Even though she became pregnant with another man's baby, David agreed to care for the child as if it were his won . On top of this, David paid £2,000 up front on clothes stock and began working overtime to pay for everything. But in October 2014, he received a worrying text message from an unknown number which read: 'Your wife has married a Gambian man, is pregnant by him and living in his family compound in the town of Bakau.' David said: 'I was devastated. Through tears she admitted she had cheated on me while I was back in England. 'She said she was now four months pregnant with his baby.It was heart breaking but at the end of the day, she was my wife. I agreed to raise the baby as my own.' David bought maternity clothes and baby bits for Ndey and in November 2014 he moved to Gambia to live with his wife, but his happiness was short lived. Later that month he received another anonymous text saying: 'Your wife has three husbands, two white and one black.' In the final moments of their relationship, suspicious David hired a private investigator to unearth the truth about his beloved wife who kept disappearing for weeks on end. Within 48 hours they had tracked Ndey down and discovered she was living in a compound with an illegitimate husband and his family. David added: 'Words cannot explain how distraught I was. I couldn't believe she would do this to me, after everything I had done for her. My trust was completely shattered.' In January this year David contacted the police and Ndey was arrested and charged with bigamy and fraud. David with Ndey on the day of their wedding . She was fined 15000 Dalassi - ten years' salary - and will face two years in prison if she fails to pay by the end of April. Betrayed, David is now desperate to recover the £24,000 he spent on Ndey over the last four years. He said: 'I refuse to divorce her until she pays me back every last penny. I have been left with nothing - no home in England, no pension, no savings, just £45 a week to live on. 'I can't even move back to the UK because I can't afford it. 'As they say, love is blind. After all those years I finally found love, and it totally backfired. 'Our whole relationship was a lie, and I had no idea. The fact that she so willingly took my money as well is just heartless. The text David received telling him that his wife was pregnant with another man's baby . 'Looking back now, I should have seen the signs but I was a fool. A fair few people tried to warn me but I was having none of it. Gullible doesn't even cover it.' Despite everything he's been through, David is now dating Isatou Jarju, 30, a cafe owner who he met when Isatou was working in a cafe with Ndey. As Isatou's British husband had just left her, the pair bonded over their misfortune and although the relationship is still in the early stages, he says marriage 'isn't off the cards.' He said: 'She is different to Ndey and I can only hope it works this time. She seems trustworthy and never asks me for anything. 'She has her own business, home and is beautiful. Above everything, she makes me laugh and has brought a smile to my face while I've been dealing with everything. 'She is very special to me.' Not bothered by warnings from family and friends, David is hoping to prove them wrong with his third Gambian lover. He said: 'My loved ones who know what has happened are absolutely disgusted that she would treat me like this. 'They think I'm mad for dating another African lady but at the end of the day, they want me to be happy. 'Although I'm still angry and full of hatred for Ndey, I just feel so lucky that I can finally have my happy ending.'","David Tungate, 58, from Norwich, is engaged to a 30 year old from Gambia .

2063,"(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately. After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will ""fix"" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. Pence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved. The unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm. In general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion. Sometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption. Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need. These are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community. Timing matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential. Even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences. To put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief. Public perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Writing for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful. RFRAs are not inherently evil. The message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected. The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves. A few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation, send an important message about the value of equality, and make Indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation: the real ""crossroads of America."" Doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work.","Gov.

10219,"From the outside, Anand Iyer seemed to have it all. A wife, an adorable two-year-old daughter, and a six-figure salary job with a leading tech company in San Francisco that he loved. But apparently the dream combination is not so perfect. The 36-year-old quit his job to be a house-husband - and now he couldn't be happier. Packed it in: Anand Iyer worked for fashion site Threadflip, but ditched his job to spent time at home . Speaking to Yahoo Parenting, he said: 'I started to ask myself, ""What am I working so hard for? Why are we trying to make our lives so great but aren't investing in time with our child?""' He 'felt terrible' about not seeing his little girl Ava, Iyer said, and struggled to flit between the roles of employee and dad. After working at Microsoft, he moved over to Threadflip to be their chief product officer. Though he had pushed himself to get there, he realized it might not be the goal he was aiming for. 'I wasn’t spending any time with her in the evening,' Iyer told the site. The playground, he told Yahoo, was the worst. 'I would look down at my phone a lot because I didn’t know how to socialize there. 'I didn’t know what to say. But I’m slowly starting to make my way into that circle. It’s about being there over and over again, I think. And now that I’ve done this a few times, and I’m recognizing people in the neighborhood, it’s gotten better.' So in January, he handed in his notice. Alongside Iyer's savings, his wife Shreya, 34, is supporting the family with her job as a recruitment manager at data analytics firm Splunk. He concedes that it feels uneasy at times: 'I've had occasional sleepless nights over our finances. 'But the reality is that I’m fortunate that I’ve been working nonstop for a long time so it wasn’t as difficult a transition for us financially as it could have been.' Iyer is part of a growing faction of men who are subverting the traditional parental set-up to spend more time with their children. According to a recent study by Pew Research, 46 per cent of fathers are dissatisfied with the amount of time they spend with their children. Though he may consider working part-time when Ava starts school, he has vowed to make sure she remains his focus.

Hundreds of people are seen watching without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Arrest: Delone' Martistee, 22, (left) and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, (right) have been arrested in connection with the alleged rape after police in Troy, Alabama, found the clip on a cell phone during another investigation . Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. Troy University students Delone' Martistee, 22, and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, have been suspended from college while they are detained for questioning, WSFA reports. Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen branded the video the 'most disgusting, sickening thing'. According to McKeithen, one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. He told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped.

'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' According to the Panama City News Herald, the woman believes she was drugged before the attack. She told deputies during an interview that she was afraid to report the incident because she couldn't remember many details.","Police in Troy, Alabama, found the video while investigating a shooting .

4464,"Most scientists agree that a bit of stress is good for you, stimulating your body to produce an important hormone called cortisol. But too much is bad for your health and now an expert has revealed exactly why in a video. In it she reveals why prolonged periods of stress - due to money and work, for example - can inhibit the immune system and even lead to weaker bones. Scroll down for video . A University of Nebraska researcher has revealed why stress is bad for you in a video (still image shown). Limited periods of stress are good, as they release the hormone cortisol. This is useful in helping you recover from very tense situations. But too much will lower your immune system and make your bones fragile. The science of stress was explained in a video by Dr Raychelle Burks from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for the American Chemical Society. Cortisol is known as the 'stress hormone'. Normally, it's present in the body at higher levels in the morning, and at its lowest at night. Although stress isn't the only reason that cortisol is secreted into the bloodstream, it has been termed the 'stress hormone' as it is released when the body is in 'fight or flight' mode. As she explains, when you encounter a stressful situation ‘your body will start releasing [the hormones] adrenaline and norepinephrine within seconds to prepare you to fight - or more likely, take flight.’ After a minute or two your body is flooded with cortisol, which is vital in keeping you healthy in tense situations. Cortisol puts more glucose into your bloodstream so that when the adrenaline is gone you don’t crash. ‘It also kicks your liver into gear, pumping out the extra glucose that’s now sloshing around inside of you,’ Dr Burks explained. But if you stay stressed for too long, it can have negative effects. After a minute or two of being stressed (stock image shown), your body is flooded with cortisol, which is vital in keeping you healthy in tense situations. But too much will lower your immune system, and could also make your bones more fragile, according to Dr Raychelle Burks from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln . ‘Cortisol inhibits some of your immune responses, meaning you’re more likely to get sick and it takes longer for wounds to heal,’ Dr Burks continued. ‘Cortisol also slows bone growth, meaning sustained levels can lead to weaker, more fragile bones. ‘And because cortisol acts on a part of your brain that controls appetite, it also increases your desire for fatty and sugary foods.’ One positive side effect of too much cortisol, though, is that cortisol is good at reducing swelling or itching in its medical form - known as hydrocortisone. However, remaining stressed for too long is still not advisable - and Dr Burks recommends eating healthy food, exercising and getting plenty of sleep to beat stress.","University of Nebraska researcher has revealed why stress is bad for you .

2881,"This is the moment a young boy's dream came true when he met his hero R2D2 at a Star Wars convention and the pair danced along the corridor together. The child's infectious giggles can be heard after R2D2 followed him around Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California and the pair began spinning around each other in circles. Clearly a fan, the boy was dressed in a Star Wars t-shirt and had merchandise fixed to his wheelchair to promote the new film, the Force Awakens. A young Star Wars fan giggled in delight when he was approached by his favourite character R2D2 . The robot began turning in time with the boy and he can be heard on video giggling loudly and uncontrollably . In the video, which shows the boy  giggling with delight, the blue and white robot dances approaches him and copies the child as he begins to turn on his wheels. As the youngster makes his way down the corridor the robot follows him and pauses, mirroring the child's every move. He is then heard giggling loudly and uncontrollably as other children watch the pair. Chris Lee, who claimed he was in charge of the robot, wrote on YouTube: 'This was the second interaction that we had with this awesome kid.

504,"No footballer has ever been late for kick-off because he was tied up negotiating a new contract. So, from the start, Raheem Sterling’s explanation for the end of his conversations with Liverpool did not stand up. It isn’t the talks that are the distraction. It is the thinking. No player is sat in an office haggling over image rights, only to check his watch at 3.30pm and bolt out of the door. A player may feel uncertainty about his future. His brain may whirl over where he will play next season. Liverpool? Arsenal? Abroad? Yet postponing the process to the end of the season doesn’t solve that issue. If anything, it makes it worse. If Sterling wanted to stop thinking right now, he could sign his new deal or tell Liverpool to come back in a year. He has, after all, got more than two seasons left on his existing arrangement. Raheem Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer . Sterling (right) has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool . The 20-year-old gave an interview to the BBC on Wednesday giving his reasons for his decision . So all Sterling did, the day his advisers ended negotiations until May at the earliest, was complicate his affairs. It is not as if he will be able to forget about the decision in the coming weeks, particularly as his stance appears to have damaged his relationship with Liverpool’s supporters. Without doubt, they were dissatisfied with his attitude even before this week’s ill-conceived BBC interview. As Liverpool’s hopes of a Champions League place next season became increasingly remote with the home defeat against Manchester United, Sterling bore the brunt of the dissent. In truth, his performance was little worse than any of his team-mates that day - but he is the one who is seen as disloyal, as rejecting at the first opportunity the club and manager that have best developed his game. Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers have done well by Sterling. They made him a key player in last season’s title near miss, got him to the World Cup. He owes them a little more respect than has been displayed in recent weeks. He owes them enough to know it is downright rude to talk of being flattered by Arsenal just days before the teams meet. Liverpool are entitled to think it is equally flattering for a club of its stature to offer a salary worth more than £5million annually. Apparently not. Sterling (left) shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers during training on Thursday . Sterling has played in various positions this season under Rodgers - including as a striker and at wing back . Among the reasons advanced for Sterling’s coldness towards a long-term commitment at Liverpool has been Rodgers’s recent decision to play him at right wing back. This has been a result of injuries and suspensions, rather than a long-term strategy - but it does raise wider questions regarding the mindset of English players, and why many might find their pathway blocked. Would a young player brought up through Ajax’s system, for instance, be so affronted by this temporary change? Why is it the English in particular that see football in straight lines? Sterling has played as a centre forward, a No 10, a wide midfielder and now a wing back. Isn’t this the versatility that we envy in the best foreign teams? Isn’t this an education? Why is it that England produces pigeon-holed full backs or midfielders, and not footballers? Shouldn’t a player - certainly one who wishes to command in excess of £100,000 a week - be able to fill in anywhere? Indeed, shouldn’t he welcome that endorsement from his manager? Arsenal progressed to the 2006 Champions League final at a time when Ashley Cole was injured. In his place through the knockout stages, home and away against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal, was the 22-year-old French midfielder Mathieu Flamini. He hadn’t played full back in his entire professional career, he said. But he never complained, and Arsenal didn’t concede in any of his six matches. Midfielder Mathieu Flamini (right) was used a full back in Arsenal's run to the 2006 Champions League final . Flamini isn’t a creative in Sterling’s mould - but then right wing back isn’t the same as left back, either. Sterling is still operating as a winger when Liverpool attack. Flamini, a central midfielder, was used strictly as a defender. It wasn’t as if Arsene Wenger was gung-ho in those games: three ended goalless, two in 1-0 victories. Flamini performed with exceptional discipline. One imagines that midfielder Emre Can didn’t sign for Liverpool expecting to be part of a back three. Rodgers first used him as a defender this season against Burnley in December, and he has remained there ever since. Can is German, though, the product of a more intellectually vibrant football culture. World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm eagerly switched between holding midfield and full back. Midfield lynchpin Bastian Schweinsteiger began his career as a right winger, while Thomas Muller can play centre forward, support striker, attacking midfielder and winger. Every player will have a favourite position but in England these desires become entrenched. Even the most gifted, such as Steven Gerrard, never seemed entirely at ease with his versatility. Maybe Sterling should spend his time thinking less about his contract and more about the type of footballer he wishes to be; maybe about the type of footballer who can demand more than £100,000 a week. Because that player goes wherever his team needs him — and that makes him worth the coin. Sterling's Liverpool team-mate Emre Can (centre) has been used mainly in defence, despite being a midfielder .","Raheem Sterling has turned down a Liverpool deal worth £100,000-a-week .

Last week he was escorted off the premises - just days after he vandalized his ex-girlfriend's car.

5547,"Around 16 million tourists visit Florence every year. It's popularity is not surprising - the city contains over sixty per cent of the world's art heritage. But for its population of 350,000, that's an overwhelming figure. So a new initiative set up by Prince Ottaviano de’Medici di Toscana, representative of the Historic House of the Medici, is aiming to reclaim the city, saving it from the ruins of mass tourism. Around 16 million tourists visit Florence every year, visiting historical sights such as the Duomo, pictured here . The last ten years have seen a steep incline in the amount of visitors to the city. Vandals have destroyed historic monuments, an influx of fast-food outlets now line the major thoroughfares and binge-drinking tourists have been seen urinating in the streets and sleeping rough. About 1.5 million cruise tourists arrive via bus from Livorno and La Spezia each year, staying in Florence for just a couple of hours, clogging the streets and adding little to the economy. And as large franchises move in, local shopkeepers and artisans have moved out. And as many as 100,000 native Florentines have left the city to escape traffic  and high property prices. Vandals have destroyed historic monuments, an influx of fast-food outets now line the major thoroughfares and binge-drinking tourists have been seen urinating in the streets and sleeping rough . Prince Ottaviano worries that Florence's cultural significance has been radically altered. 'There is an absolute lack of laws to protect the city from uncontrolled mass tourism and insufficient maintenance of buildings, monuments, urban spaces, and works of art,' he told the National Geographic. 'The situation became even worse to my eyes when I discovered that the police don’t have any agent—not even one!—who can certify the state of decay of building façades and require owners to make repairs.' Snapping a selfie at the Duomo, left, and tourists at the fountain of Neptune, Piazza Della Signoria, right . Prince Ottaviano has proposed adding Florence, already a World Heritage City, to UNESCO's endangered list. The Save Florence campaign aims to appeal to 'true travellers' rather than tourists blitzing the city in a couple of hours. Rather than mass tourism, the prince wants to attract visitors with its traditions of food and craft, its lesser known museums and smaller hotels. And another Florence aficionado, tour operator Mark Gordon Smith, is aiming to bring the city's decline into public view, through a series of short video documentaries. The Italy specialist is hoping to fund his project, to showcase Florence's hidden gems, the neighbourhoods tourists usually miss, as well as the damage being done by disrespecting visitors, via Kickstarter. Tour operator Mark Gordon Smith wants to show the city's decline through a series of short documentaries . On his fundraising page, he says: 'The city of Florence Italy is in peril'. 'The monuments and streets which lead from the Accademia through the Piazza Duomo to the Piazza della Signoria and the Uffizi are showing immeasurable damage; graffiti on historic monuments, visitors using the streets as a bathroom, people sleeping in the loggias of Santissima Annunziata and the Ospedale degli Innocenti.' He is hoping the short films will be distributed across the world to raise awareness.","Around 16 million tourists visit Florence - population 350,000, every year .

The 2013 finalist looked set to ease through to the last 16 after resuming on Monday with a 7-2 overnight lead which he extended to 9-4 to move within one frame of victory. But Selt responded by reeling off five frames in a row - including back-to-back centuries - before a cool clearance from Hawkins saw him into the second round with a 10-9 win. Barry Hawkins celebrates after qualifying for the second round of the World Snooker Championship . Hawkins kept his composure to win 10-9 after Matthew Selt's impressive comeback at the Crucible . Selt won five frames in a row to launch a comeback, however he was unable to progress to the second round . Hawkins said: 'I can't keep putting myself through that. There's nothing worse than when someone is coming back at you like that and you can see your lead disappearing. 'You're telling yourself it's only one frame but you can see him growing in confidence and potting long balls so it is a horrible place to be.' Hawkins, who will play either Mark Allen or Ryan Day in the second round, is no stranger to Crucible drama having fended off a famous comeback from Dominic Dale in last year's quarter-finals. And the 35-year-old from Kent believes his close call against Selt will help give him the impetus he needs after a largely frustrating season by his own standards. Hawkins added: 'It's not been the best season but it's partly my own fault because I had a bad attitude in the middle of the season and I wasn't enjoying it. 'I've played a lot of snooker over the last couple of years and I think I just got fed up with it and my attitude stunk, I suppose. 'But there's nothing like getting kicked up the backside a few times and getting beaten to get the motivation back.' Former champion Neil Robertson wasted no time wrapping up victory over Jamie Jones to move into the last 16. Resuming like Hawkins with a 7-2 overnight advantage, Robertson did things the easy way with an opening break of 133 setting him up to reel off the three frames required for a 10-2 win.

Allardyce's side had been on track for their first back-to-back home wins in almost four months but having already had two goals ruled out for offside, Arnautovic eventually punished the fading hosts to earn a draw. Aaron Cresswell had given the home side an early lead at Upton Park but after a strong start it was Stoke who ended up dominating and they left with a deserved point.

It is the fourth time this year that a late goal has cost the ninth-placed Hammers after draws at Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and the defeat at Leicester City last week. Without the late goals they could be above Swansea City and sitting on a club-record 50 points. 'We can't find the right key elements to see that game out. We leave ourselves on a nervous edge,' Allardyce said. 'We are very nervous at that stage over what's happened before and we should be on 50 points now. We've thrown away seven points in two minutes or less in four games. 'If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League. Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but it finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.' West Ham's performances have dipped since a strong start to the season but there was no sign of any supposed complacency early on against Stoke, and the reawakening coincided with the return of Enner Valencia. It was Stoke's inability to deal with him led to the opening goal after seven minutes. Glenn Whelan tripped Valencia five yards outside the penalty area to give West Ham an opportunity to shoot from the dead ball. Mark Noble looked the most likely candidate and when he stepped over the ball it seemed to leave goalkeeper Asmir Begovic confused. Instead, unlikely scorer Cresswell was the chosen one and he sent the free-kick over the wall and curling into the Bosnian stopper's top left-hand corner to give West Ham the lead with his second goal of the season.

West Ham were well on top, and Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate could have added to the lead inside the opening 20 minutes. But as the half wore on it was Stoke who looked the more likely to score. Valencia's influence waned and instead it was Arnautovic who took control, dominating Cresswell down West Ham's left-hand side. Charlie Adam curled an ambitious free-kick over the bar from 40 yards out in search of his second wonder goal in a week before Jonathan Walters silenced an impatient Upton Park with a low strike that looked to have gone in but had instead hit Adrian's side netting. Victor Moses also had an opportunity, bringing down Arnautovic's cross inside the penalty area, spinning and firing in a shot that was deflected just wide. Allardyce would have been pleased just to see his side make it through to half-time unscathed and Stoke went in at the break with a sense of injustice after hearing referee Roger East blow his whistle as they prepared for the latest in a series of dangerous corners. A low-key opening to the second half allowed the home side to settle a bit and they looked the better side until a mistake by Winston Reid gave Adam a chance on the hour mark but a bobble came to the rescue and the Scot shot wide.

Minutes later Arnautovic had the ball in the net, slotting past Adrian, but his run was correctly flagged for offside. The Spanish keeper's goal seemed to be living a charmed life and particularly so as Stoke went within an inch of equalising. Jonathan Walters sent in a cross from the right that was met by the unmarked head of substitute Mame Biram Diouf, who powered an effort towards goal only to see it bounce off the inside of the post, along the goal line and somehow staying out. West Ham looked like throwing it all away again late on. Arnautovic found Adrian's net for a second time but was again flagged for offside. But the Austrian wasn't to be denied and he eventually scored with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end. Stephen Ireland flicked the ball on and Arnautovic applied the finish, slipping the ball into the corner to leave a familiar scene for the home support. Stoke manager Mark Hughes said: 'It looked for a long time that we weren't going to be able to do it. 'When we got into the fourth minute of added on time it looked as though it wasn't going to be our day. Credit to the lads, I thought they were brilliant.'

10659,"(CNN)The American Pharmacists Association is discouraging its members from participating in executions. On Monday, the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy, stating that ""such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers."" This bolsters the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term ""drug"" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases. The group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection, said Michelle Spinnler, spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. That spotlight includes a January Supreme Court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in Oklahoma. This was prompted by Clayton Lockett's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack. In Georgia last month, the execution of female death row inmate Kelly Renee Gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy. Thirty-two sates allow capital punishment, and lethal injection is still the most common method. Last month, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available. Of the eight inmates currently on death row in Utah, three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad. Pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection. In Texas, the department of criminal justice told CNN in March they are running out of their supply. In July 2011, Lundbeck Inc., the manufacturer of pentobarbital, decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment. The companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose, so states then turned to compounded preparations, Spinnler said. ""Pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way."" she says. The new declaration by the American Pharmacists Association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology.","The American Pharmacists Association passed a new policy banning members from participating in lethal injections .
Pharmacists say role as health care providers conflicts with participation in lethal injection .

8436,"A Georgia woman is speaking out about her refusal to follow doctors' advice and pull the plug on her husband of just seven months following a devastating motorcycle crash. Danielle Davis says she looked to her faith when she was faced with the prospect of losing her husband Brian in 2011, just seven months after they were married. 'I knew that God could get us through that,' she said, in an interview at the couple's Georgetown home Tuesday. 'I didn't think that it was too big for God.' Scroll down for video . Tragic: Danielle Davis says she looked to her faith when she was faced with the prospect of losing her husband Brian in 2011, just seven months after they were married when he was involved in a near fatal motorcycle crash . Davis tells WTOC that doctors told her they would have chosen to pull the plug had they been in her position. 'That's what they'd want their family to do,' she recalls hearing them say. But she refused to give up and Brian was eventually released into her care. Weeks went by and one day, miraculously, Brian spoke. 'I'm trying,' he told her. Danielle would soon come to the painful conclusion that Brian had no idea she was his wife. Brian tells WTOC that he also had no clue his father was dead or that he'd been married to begin with. Three years had been wiped from his memory for good. Though, finding out Danielle was his wife was a happy moment among many struggles. 'I saw her, and I was like, 'yeah,'' he recalls. Hopeless: Brian's motorcycle was split in two and doctors initially urged his wife to take him off life support . Danielle refused to give up on Brian and took him into her full time care as he was still bedridden and hooked to a feeding tube . Miracle: Eventually, Brian started to improve and miraculously spoke the words 'I'm trying' one day weeks after Danielle took him home with dismal prospects . Now, he and Danielle work on his rehabilitation daily and use yoga to help him sharpen his mind and regain control of his body. While Danielle is thrilled that Brian has improved to the point he no longer requires medications, she says on a GoFundMe page started for the cause that the couple is too strapped to pay for all the rehabilitative care Brian still requires. And insurance will no longer cover it. 'People with Traumatic Brain Injury need a lot of rehab, people continue to make improvements even 10 years after their injury,' she writes. 'Insurance doesn't pay for the amount of therapy they need so often times that person doesn't reach their full potential.' Thankfully, after just one month, the fundraiser has received some $11,000 in donations. As Brian continues to make great strides, most recently with his commitment to learning to walk the way he once did, he wants others to know how good they've got it. 'People don't realize how much they can actually do with their bodies,' he said. 'They take it for granted.' Improvements: Now Danielle says Brian is improving all the time and has gone from requiring 20 medications per day to requiring none .","Danielle Davis of Savannah, Georgia looked to her faith after her husband Brian nearly died seven months after they were married in 2011 .

5033,"He's part of one of the most famous, most watched, most talked-about families on the planet. But over the last year, Rob Kardashian - brother to Kim, Kourtney and Khloe - has all but disappeared from the media spotlight. And now in newly released clips from this week's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians his family have once again expressed their concern for the once gregarious but now reclusive 28-year-old. Scroll down for video . Rob Kardashian is rarely seen out and about and is thought to have struggled with his weight gain over the recent years . For it's been nearly a year since Rob seemed to vanish from the public eye. A former fixture on red carpets and social media, he now rarely tweets, his Instagram contains just one post and he is rarely pictured outside his house. It's a far cry from the fun loving Rob we were once used to seeing on our screens, when in the early series of KUWTK he would spend his days partying and larking about with his sisters. Confident and good looking Rob was even filmed trying out to be a model having been encouraged to do so by Kim. In 2008 he even took a spin on Dancing With The Stars - the popular US dancing equivalent to Strictly Come Dancing. But now multiple sources say that Rob is in a 'dark place,' and his sister Khloe has previously revealed that she believes her brother suffers from social anxiety. Rob was previously a regular at red carpet events, he is pictured here with Kim at the opening of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casion in 2009 . Radar Online recently reported that Rob terrified his family last weekend when he didn't contact them for three days, bringing them close to calling the police. And there has long been speculation that Rob has long been tortured by his fame and uncomfortable with his family's increasing notoriety. Some point to December 2012, when his relationship with Rita Ora broke down, as the moment in which the cracks began to show. He took to Twitter to lambaste the singer accusing her of cheating on him. In tweets that he later deleted Rob said: 'She cheated on me with nearly 20 dudes while we were together... But I mean 20?!!!!' He later added: 'How can a woman who is so busy trying to start her own career have time to be with so many dudes while in a relationship?!' In happier days Rob posed with his sisters Kim, Kourtney and Khloe at a club in Las Vegas . Rob, pictured here with his whole family in 2011, used to be happy to be part of the Keeping Up With The Kardashians, however, he is no longer on the show . Rita responded to the tweets  saying: 'When you are involved with someone for a while and they decide to express their feelings to the public, well, that's not my personal way of therapy but I guess everyone takes split-ups differently… . 'You should have to sit an exam before you go on Twitter. To see if you're mentally stable.' She also said that she had never thought of their relationship as a serious boyfriend/girlfriend commitment. Rob cut a slim figure in 2012 but has since piled on the pounds, something he is said to have struggled with . Then last year Rob shocked onlookers when he decided to pull out of his own sister's wedding. When Kim married Kanye West in Italy last summer Rob was notably absent. Despite having traveled with his family to Europe he turned around at the last minute and went home. Kim has since revealed that he only told her of his decision on the morning of her big day. She said: 'He sent me a long email the morning of (the wedding), that he was going to leave. She added, 'I just thought, ""You know what, this is my day. I'm not even going to worry about it"".' It has been widely speculated that Rob's current lack of confidence comes from his weight and that he didn't attend the nuptials because he was worried about being photographed. Over the last few years the star has piled on the pounds and in episodes of KUWTK filmed before he departed from the show he was often heard talking about his weight. Rob shocked his Instagram followers when he posted this picture of Amy Adams character from Gone Girl saying that it was his sister Kim . On several occasions he went on diets and his sisters tried to help him lose the pounds and stay away from his beloved fast food, but nothing seemed to work. And whilst the man himself is yet to comment on his disappearance, his family have been quite vocal about his issues. His elder sister Khloe has previously revealed that she believes that Rob suffers from social anxiety. She said: 'I just feel, especially over the last year, Rob has become very introverted and has a kind of social anxiety. 'He's definitely not at his happiest place that he once was, and I know he can get to that happy place and he will. 'We all kind of get to a place where you don't know where to go in life or whatever, so I think it's important for him to know that he always has people to lean on and it's not unnatural for people to not know where to begin. It's a growing process. 'I will always be his number one supporter.' In a new episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians Rob's Mother Kris (left) and his sister Kim (right) are seen arguing about how best to handle him . Rob was a popular member of the KUWTK cast but he is now rarely seen on the show . In clips from this week's show the family are once again seen discussing how best to help him. In one clip Kris says that the family has 'all the resources in the world,' to help her son. However, Kim is less kind, butting into the conversation and telling her mum and Khloe: 'Now what we have to do is everyone back off.' She continues: 'Everyone licks Rob's ass and does everything he says and it's just at some point you have to give it up. 'We all make his life so easy: ""Okay we'll drive you around with a chauffeur so no one has to look at you."" We had a chef on standby, a trainer, we'll send people to run out and buy you socks and underwear. 'Like this is pathetic. We're not going to cater to him any more but it has to be all of us.' Kris suggests 'maybe he can't help himself,' but Kim quickly replies: 'No he is still competent to where he can ask for help when he needs it.' Rob poses with his sister Kourtney (left) and his Mum and sister Kim (right) Rob cut a lonely figure when he was spotted at his Malibu home . Although neither of them have commented on it it seems things have been rather frosty between Kim and Rob of late. Rob recently raised eyebrows when he posted a picture of Amy Adams character in Gone Girl to his Instagram with the cryptic caption: 'This is my sister kim , the b**** from Gone Girl...' In a further clip from the hit reality TV show Kris told Khloe how she would like to help her troubled son. The matriarch said: 'I'm really, really, really worried about Rob. 'I talked to this guy that came highly recommended and he seems to think that everything I described about Rob is textbook and that he could come with all the proper people and help him but do it at home.' However the youngest Kardashian sibling still lives with Khloe, who  expressed her reservations. She said: 'So now you guys want to now have an outsider come in and ambush Rob  and basically ambush me. 'Neither you, nor Kourtney, nor Kim have even like attempted to see him for numerous days in a row. Do you even know his daily routines? Anything? No because you guys aren't there.' However, in a final clip released from the show it seems Khloe is as desperate as her mother to get him some help. The 30-year-old is seen taking a break from a hike to call her brother. Although Rob's side of the conversation can not be heard it is clear that it is causing Khloe some distress as she starts crying. 'You leave every facility that we take you to,' she is seen telling him on a phone call. And at the end of the call she exclaims: 'Just accept the f***ing help!'","Rob Kardashian, 28, has taken disappeared from the media spotlight .

9457,"(CNN)Chinese police have arrested more than 133,000 people and seized 43.3 tons of illegal narcotics during a six-month anti-drug campaign, the country's Ministry of Public Security has announced. Authorities also handled 115,000 drug-related crimes -- such as robbery -- and 606,000 cases of drug use during the nationwide campaign to ""ban drugs in hundreds of cities,"" Liu Yuejin, Assistant Minister of Public Security, said Wednesday. The figures were nearly double the same period a year earlier, while the amount of narcotics seized was up by 44.9%, according to the ministry. Liu said drug trafficking groups have ""suffered a heavy blow"" and drug users have been ""forcefully regulated."" However, the police also paid a price, Liu said, in quotes carried by the state-run Xinhua news agency. Nine police officers died and another 657 were wounded in the mission, with 76 severely wounded. The ministry rewarded 60 units and 100 people. Liu said China's drug-related problems were still severe, with online drug trafficking an increasing problem. He said the ministry had launched a three-month online campaign starting in April targeting people engaged in drug-related Internet crimes. Over the past nine months, a string of movie and television stars, film directors and pop singers have been arrested and charged over drug related incidents, including Jaycee Chan, son of kung fu movie star Jackie Chan, who was convicted on a drug charge and sentenced to six months in prison by a Beijing court. In August last year, dozens of management agencies representing actors and singers signed an agreement with Beijing authorities banning drug use from the entertainment industry and pledging to sack any artists who broke the law.","Police arrest 133,000 people and seize 43.3 tons of narcotics in a six-month period .

1777,"The probe into the suicide of a 12-year-old girl was more of a 'publicity stunt' than an investigation, according to a new lawsuit. Rebecca Sedwick leaped to her death from the roof of an abandoned concrete plant in Lakeland, Florida in September 2013. The following month, the Polk County Sheriff's Office said she likely killed herself following 'malicious harassment' from two schoolmates, Katelyn Roman, then 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 13. Both girls, who were students at Crystal Lake Middle School, were arrested on charges of aggravated stalking and the sheriff's office distributed their names and mug shots. Suicide: Rebecca Sedwick, pictured with her mother, took her life in 2013 and two girls were arrested for bullying her but later released. One of the girls has now filed a lawsuit against the sheriff's department . Authorities claimed they bullied Rebecca online and sent her messages such as 'go kill yourself'. But the charges were dropped when police were unable to find any evidence of the messages. On Wednesday, lawyers representing the family of the youngest girl filed a lawsuit naming Sheriff Grady Judd and Deputy Jonathan McKinney, the Orlando Sentinel reported. It accuses them of using Rebecca's death as an 'opportunity for media attention' and says that they maliciously deemed the girl 'the poster child example of a cyber-bully'. She was arrested without any factual basis, according to the lawsuit. It also accuses the sheriff's office of falsely telling the media that the girl had admitted to bullying Rebecca, even though this was false. Arrested: Katelyn Roman, 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 13, were arrested a month after the suicide for allegedly bullying the girl - but the charges were dropped when police filed to find evidence of harassment . Defiant: After the charges was dropped, Katelyn went on the Today show with her parents and attorney and denied she had ever bullied the 12-year-old girl. Her family has now filed a lawsuit in Polk County . 'Although the charges were unsubstantiated and ultimately dropped, the incident left [jer] devastated and irreparably damaged,' the lawsuit says. Named: Sheriff Grady Judd, pictured, is accused of using Rebecca's death for 'media attention' Last year, it was reported that Katelyn had the third highest state testing score in Polk County but feared that she would no longer be able to continue her education after being suspended. The family is seeking at least $15,000 in damages. A representative for the sheriff's office said the claims 'have no merit'. Following Rebecca's death, Judd claimed  that Guadalupe had posted online: 'Yes [I know] I bullied REBECCA and she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***].' Judd said the message led to her arrest, explaining: 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' But Guadalupe claimed her account had been hacked and the charges were ultimately dropped. The rift between the girls allegedly came after Guadalupe started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. At the time, the teen boy told DailyMail.com that the girls fell out because he still liked Rebecca. Rebecca's computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like: 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl?' Last summer, Rebecca's mother, Tricia Norman, filed a lawsuit in Polk County, seeking more than $15,000 from each of the defendants over the death of her daughter. Heartbroken: Rebecca's mother, pictured, filed her own lawsuits against the accused bullies last year . Norman, who said her 'happiness no longer exists', said the school failed to properly supervise the girl accused of stalking her daughter, even though they were allegedly aware of the situation. She also claims Cemex Construction Material in Lakeland did not properly care for the perimeter fence at the abandoned facility, allowing the 12-year-old to easily scale it and jump. Rebecca's mother previously told WFTV that her daughter had been bullied online for months. 'I keep waiting for an apology that I know will never come,' she said after her daughter passed away.

204,"(CNN)The world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two-year shutdown. After problems that delayed the restart in March, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) completed final tests, enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC's 17 mile (27 km) ring. ""Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for,"" CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization's website. ""Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC."" The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. It took thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator, housed in a tunnel between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountain range. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the ""Big Bang"" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. By replicating the energy density and temperature, scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved. Our current, limited, knowledge is based on what's called The Standard Model of particle physics.  ""But we know that this model is not complete,"" Dr. Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the LHC, told CNN in March. The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy, while others have no mass at all; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy, since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang. CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by Swiss and French laws and a European Council Directive. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown. ""After two years of effort, the LHC is in great shape,"" said CERN Director for Accelerators and Technology, Frédérick Bordry. ""But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels."" Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.","The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) begins again after a two-year shutdown .

2192,"Eye of the Beholder . by Laura J Snyder . (Head of Zeus, £25) The behaviour of Dutch natural scientist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek was nothing if not eccentric. In 1677, at the age of 41, he embarked on an extraordinarily gruesome experiment, using his body as a guinea pig. Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (pictured in a portrait ) used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment . He took three lice, nestled them among the hairs of his calf, rolled up a tight stocking so that the insects were bound to his leg and then left the stocking on and did not bathe for six days. On the seventh day, he removed the stocking and counted more than 80 eggs but no young lice. In the interests of empiricism, the stocking went back on for another three days. Finally, the stocking came off to reveal at least 25 lice running up and down his leg. ‘This spectacle of all the young lice filled me with such aversion to the stocking,’ he wrote, ‘that I threw it, along with all the lice in it, out the window.’ He rubbed down his legs with ice, then took up his pen to calculate the louse’s reproduction rate. He estimated that two pairs of lice could generate 10,000 young in only eight weeks. While Leeuwenhoeck was thus engaged, another great Dutchman, Johannes Vermeer, was intent on his own more genteel studies in his house on the opposite side of Delft’s market square. Draped in a black cloth, Vermeer spent hours peering into the box-like interior of a camera obscura, an ancestor of the photographic camera. This was a light-tight wooden chamber with a hole or lens on one side, which could be used to project an image of a scene on to a glass plate or wall. They had been used for party tricks and for viewing solar eclipses but were increasingly being employed by artists to render paintings more lifelike than ever. The experiments of these two men are the subject of Laura J. Snyder’s new biography. She asks an intriguing question: could Vermeer and Leeuwenhoek, who were born in the same week, lived and worked their entire lives in an area not much larger than a football pitch, and who had friends in common, have exchanged ideas and inspired each other’s work? This is much more than a joint biography. It is a portrait of an age of insatiable intellectual curiosity. The 17th century gave us an inventory of instruments which far extended man’s understanding of the world: accurate thermometers and barometers, the air pump, the pendulum clock, improvements to the telescope, the refinement of the microscope. Leeuwenhoek’s mastery of lens-grinding saw him build a microscope capable of magnification up to 480 times. Scientists and dilettanti assembled cabinets of curiosity filled with rare animal and shell specimens. Leeuwenhoek’s collection included the eye of a whale, pickled in brandy. Anatomical theatres for the dissection of bodies were built in Padua, Bologna, Leiden, Delft and Amsterdam. According to one chronicler, sumptuously dressed ladies would attend dissections of the bodies of executed criminals and then go straight to that night’s ball. Snyder moves effortlessly not just between Vermeer’s studio and Leeuwenhoek’s laboratory, but all over Europe, from the universities of Italy, to the halls of the Royal Society in London, then the world’s pre-eminent scientific institution. Leeuwenhoeck wrote about 300 letters to the Royal Society, charting 50 years of experiments. He addressed them as ‘curious gentlemen dabblers’. One of his great discoveries was the observation of thousands of swimming creatures, which he called animaculae or little animals, in murky water. He estimated there could be more than eight million of them in a single drop. Later generations would recognise them as bacteria. He was also the first scientist to observe the existence and movement of sperm. No one had yet seen the human sperm or the egg or understood their part in reproduction. Leeuwenhoek politely wrote to the President of the Royal Society: ‘What I investigate is only what, without sinfully defiling myself, remains as a residue of conjugal coitus.’ One feels a certain amount of sympathy for his wife, Cornelia. What with the lice and the post-conjugal microscope experiments, she must have been a very patient woman. The great pleasure of this book is how Snyder makes the science clear to the layman. I have a degree in history of art and only one measly science GCSE in biology. Yet I was left more eager to peer down the lens at one of Leeuwenhoek’s slides, than to stand before even the most pellucid of Vermeer’s exquisite paintings.","At 41 van Leeuwenhoek used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment .

6926,"A hospital which ran out of space to store bodies in its mortuary after 'an unprecedented number of deaths' resorted to leaving them in a refrigerated lorry parked next to a load of bins, it has emerged. Bosses at Queen's Hospital, Burton, Staffordshire, admitted they didn't tell relatives about the arrangement and a spokesman has claimed the use of a lorry is normal practice across the country. Bodies were transferred to the mortuary for viewings, then returned to the truck, according to one hospital worker. Temporary mortuary: The refrigerated lorry - where bodies were stored after the hospital ran out of space in its mortuary over the Easter weekend - parked outside Queen's Hospital in Burton, Staffordshire . Queen's Hospital in Staffordshire said it experienced an unprecedented number of deaths over the Easter weekend. Relatives were not told about the arrangement to use a refrigerated lorry as a temporary mortuary . The hospital said there were an unprecedented number of deaths over the Easter bank holiday weekend, with many undertakers closed during the four-day break. A hospital spokesman said families were not informed that their deceased relatives were kept in the refrigerated truck over the bank holiday period as it treated the temporary service as an extension of its fixed mortuary. Chief operating officer for Burton Hospitals Trust, Brendan Brown, defended the use of the lorry . Brendan Brown, chief operating officer for Burton Hospitals Trust, said that the temporary mortuary service adhered to the same robust standards and regulations as the normal mortuary. He said: 'Our priority is always patient care and ensuring that our patients and their relatives are treated with dignity and respect at all times. 'This approach extends to any essential contingency planning we may need to do as a trust, for example, the need to install temporary mortuary services when required, to help us increase capacity when faced with increased demand for those services. 'Putting the needs of patients and their families first was the basis for our decision to employ the use of temporary mortuary facilities.' Mr Brown added that the temporary facility was no longer on site as it was brought in only as and when required. A spokesman said the use of a refrigerated lorry was normal practice at hospitals across the country and, as most undertakers were closed on bank holidays, the hospital mortuary had filled up. A hospital employee said: 'Bodies were being viewed in the mortuary by relatives and then they were being transferred into this trailer and put on beds.'","Bosses admitted they didn't tell relatives about the arrangement .

7852,"Manchester City supporters sing a song with the line: 'We're not really here.' It sums up the approach of many of their fanbase – they haven't fully bought into the idea that City could be one of the giants of Europe. Celebrity fan Ricky Hatton wants 'the old City back', while rock-God City lover Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the fans. Manuel Pellegrini could be worried about his position at Manchester City after losing against their fierce rivals . (Left to right) Segio Aguero, Yaya Toure and James Milner look dejected as they await kick-off after a goal . Boxer Ricky Hatton, pictured at the Etihad for a press conference in 2008, says he wants 'the old City back' Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the City supporters . 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of their last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. One of the weirdest things I've been hearing lately is people saying Manuel Pellegrini was the right man at the right time for Manchester City. Their logic is that his calm was needed after the Roberto Mancini reign ended with a fractured dressing room, and an FA Cup final defeat at the hands of Wigan Athletic. Pellegrini is calm but it was the worst kind of short-term thinking which has led to City now clinging on to fourth place. The dressing room calmed down temporarily, but he doesn't have the character or gravitas to galvanise a group of players when the going gets tough. He's punching above his weight at Manchester City. City need to stop pussy-footing around and drag the fans into the modern game. They need to fill up the half-empty glasses of the supporters at the Etihad. Pellegrini's appointment would have suited those fans who resist the charge towards potential greatness. He is not a great manager. Look at his record before he arrived in England. He's done well but there is no evidence of greatness, and no suggestion of greatness to come. Frank Lampard applauds the travelling fans at Old Trafford as he leaves the pitch with goalkeeper Joe Hart . Louis van Gaal shakes hands with his opposite number Pellegrini after the final whistle at Old Trafford . Jose Mourinho? Ronald Koeman? Sean Dyche? Not even close... Louis van Gaal should be crowned manager of the year . Forget Eden Hazard and Michael Carrick... the best player in the Premier League this weekend was Leicester's Jamie Vardy . And so it has proved. The signings Manchester City have made have also smacked of small-time thinking. They don't go for the great players anymore, they're not in that market. Jesus Navas is the perfect example: he is quick and that's it. He missed a great chance at the start of the Manchester derby because his end product is so poor. He cost a relatively cheap £15million, but at 29 years old (he was signed in 2013), you wonder what the logic was behind this purchase. He's not good enough to be a regular in the starting line-up at a club with ambitions of dominating the Champions League and Barclays Premier League. Why weren't City in the market for Cesc Fabregas? Or Diego Costa? How come they didn't sign Angel di Maria? Financial Fair Play is often used as the excuse – it's holding City back apparently. Look at United, look at Chelsea – be cleverer with the spreadsheets and FFP isn't a problem. Aguero and Jesus Navas prepare for a free-kick at Old Trafford as the latter struggles to inspire the side . Navas is not good enough to be a regular in the starting XI at a club with ambitions of dominating Europe . City opted against going in the market for players such as Cesc Fabregas (left) and Angel di Maria . City's failure to make any kind of serious progress in Europe reflects badly on English football, but the fault is with the club. They need to think bigger and drag themselves towards greatness. Make big signings, they will improve the team, and if they arrive, they will motivate the big players already at City. Yaya Toure strikes me as the kind of player who will raise his game significantly if he had Sami Khedira alongside him, rather than Fernando. The big message out of City this season has been how brilliant and shiny their new academy set-up is. And it is truly spectacular – a world-class facility. But they don't have the team to match it and they absolutely don't have the manager. If they choose to lose Pellegrini, then they need to think big next time and go for a manager showing true potential to be great – like Diego Simeone or Jurgen Klopp. Pellegrini has been accused of punching above his weight at Premier League champions City . Diego Simeone (left) or Jurgen Klopp could be potential replacements for the City manager . Carlo Ancelotti is another that fits the bill if he was to leave current club Real Madrid at the end of the season . Two managers at less fashionable clubs, trying to fight with the big boys in their domestic league and in Europe. Or go for greatness itself – Carlo Ancelotti fits the bill, and so does the man we all expected the hierarchy at City to deliver – Pep Guardiola. When Sheik Mansour arrived at Manchester City he declared that he wanted the club to be winning in Europe. They're still not doing that, and it's about time City went to the next level, for their own good, and for the good of English football. It's like they poked their head out of United's shadow for a few seconds and got burned by the sunshine. Think big City, or forever stay small.","Manchester United 4-2 Manchester City: Click here to read the match report .

1036,"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Kathmandu is a city with few good stories right now, but Tanka Maya Sitoula has one of them. The 40-year-old mother-of-four was at home when Saturday's deadly 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck, bringing the 5-story building down around her ground floor apartment. In the wake of the disaster, which has left at least 4,500 people dead across Nepal, Sitoula endured 36 long hours trapped in a room on the ground floor, before she was freed by an Indian rescue team. Remarkably, she escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula, who talked to CNN through an interpreter, says she remained confident she would survive throughout her ordeal amid the rubble. ""I heard people making noise outside so I thought I would be rescued,"" she said, as she and her family sheltered in the grounds of a nearby school. ""I was confident that everybody was there outside and that I would be rescued."" What did she do for 36 hours? ""I was just lying down,"" she says. ""There was no room to move here and there."" Sitoula's husband Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. ""I was totally confident that she was there,"" he said. ""I never stopped calling her. And also from down below she was making sounds and I could hear her."" It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. ""I was asking people for help. Traffic police, whoever I could find. What happened was there were no tools to cut through the metal debris."" Eventually, a rescue team from India had the equipment required, he said. Throughout the ordeal, he never gave up hope, he says: ""I was confident that my wife was safe and sound."" He was only concerned about how she would fare during the attempt to free her. Inspector Karam Singh from India's National Disaster Management Authority was supervising search and rescue efforts at the Sitoulas' former home Tuesday -- a bright pink building, pancaked into two levels, with an entire wall sheared off to reveal its purple interior. He described the rescue efforts as physically draining work -- ""cutting, pushing and pulling"" -- but extremely rewarding in the case of Sitoula. ""She was happy, so so happy. She wasn't stopping praising us,"" he said. ""We said it's good to have a [survivor]."" Singh said workers had recovered one body from the building, adding that he believed eight to 10 others remained trapped inside. But as a French team of sniffer dogs completed a sweep of the ruins with no promising signs, following a search with a sensor earlier which also showed no signs of life, Singh said there was ""no chance"" of finding any survivors. As a digger worked to clear the rubble of her former home, Sitoula agreed: two days after her rescue, she says it is highly unlikely there are others as lucky as her, still surviving beneath the rubble. The prognosis is equally dire in Kathmandu's Gangabhu neighborhood, where search teams are focusing their efforts on a cluster of collapsed six-story guesthouses. A handler from a Japanese search dog team climbs down the wreckage with a stern expression. ""I'm sorry. It didn't work out,"" he tells the Nepalese police officers involved in the search and recovery effort. Officer Tejush Swarnakar, with the Nepalese armed police, says officials believe about 50 people may be trapped in the rubble. Four bodies have been recovered -- but on Monday, there was a rare survival story. Members of GEA, a Turkish volunteer search and rescue team, pulled 21-year-old John Keisi from the debris after a 13-hour rescue effort. Swarnakar's colleagues were also diverted into action nearby, when dozens of protesters block a busy thoroughfare, chanting: ""Down with the government."" There are complaints, specifically, that the government is not doing enough to prevent rising transport prices in the wake of the earthquake. A bus window is smashed and there are brief scuffles as police move in to clear the crowd using shields and long batons. A short walk away, along the banks of the Bishnumati River, residents perch precariously on the slanted roof of a collapsed building in an attempt to salvage what they can. Next door, a striking sight: a rope of knotted sheets hangs from a third-floor window. Neighbor Aakash Karki, 19, says that seven people escaped using the rope. As the sun starts to set, crowds gather in Kathmandu's Sitapali neighborhood to watch the work of a large group of rescue and recovery teams. This is where members of GEA made the first of their two rescues in Nepal at 3 a.m. Sunday, pulling Bikram Chepang, 22, from the debris of 11 collapsed buildings. Now, back at the site, there are faint hopes that a third, and remarkable, rescue may on the cards. A search dogs scouring the wreckage has given an indication that it may have detected life. The volunteers continue their search, but conclude the dog was mistaken. They don't believe there's anyone alive inside.

2420,"(CNN)Erica Kinsman, a former Florida State University student who has accused star football player Jameis Winston of rape, has filed a lawsuit against the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, her lawyer said Thursday. Kinsman has said Winston raped her in December 2012.  A prosecutor decided against bringing criminal charges in the case. In the lawsuit filed Thursday, Kinsman alleges sexual battery, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Winston has said the sex was consensual. CNN obtained the following statement from Winston's attorney David Cornwell. ""This stunt was expected,"" the statement said. ""Ms. Kinsman's false accusations have already been exposed and rejected six times.  This time will be no different. Mr. Winston welcomes the opportunity to clear his name with the truth. Mr. Winston is looking forward to the upcoming [NFL] draft.  He will not permit this ploy to distract him as he begins the journey of fulfilling his lifelong dream of being a championship quarterback in the National Football League."" CNN doesn't normally identify the alleged victims of sexual assault; however, Kinsman revealed her name this year in a documentary about rape on college campuses. FSU hearing clears Winston . Winston led the Florida State Seminoles to a national championship for the 2013 season and won the Heisman, given to the most outstanding collegiate football player. He is expected to be a top pick in the NFL Draft, which begins April 30. ""As for timing, we didn't want to wait until the eve of the draft or after he signed a contract,"" said Kinsman's attorney John Clune. ""As soon as we finished the various motions briefing on the FSU case, we turned our attention to Jameis and got it filed."" Kinsman also sued the university in January. According to police documents in the rape case, Kinsman said Winston raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in Tallahassee. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. Kinsman also said she did not remember much of what happened next but that she remembered being in a ground-floor apartment, where Winston took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections, according to police documents. Kinsman reported the alleged assault to FSU campus police that night. A month later, in January 2013, she told Tallahassee police that Winston was the attacker. Tallahassee's interim police chief at the time, Tom Coe, said the woman ""broke off contact"" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family said a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Winston didn't play during the 2012 season but came to Florida State as one of the nation's top quarterback recruits, according to recruiting rankings.","Winston's lawyer: Kinsman's ""false accusations have already been exposed and rejected six times""

10213,"We all know the time-consuming hassle of having to hoover the house, so it is perhaps no surprise to find that sailors on board this Russian aircraft carrier also got bored of sweeping the decks. What is perhaps more surprising is their solution to the problem, which involved strapping an old jet engine to the front of a tractor, and using the contraption as a huge leaf-blower. The crew of the Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's largest warship, came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing. Russian sailors on board the Admiral Kuznetsov, the country's largest  aircraft carrier, have come up with an inegnious way of cleaning the decks, by strapping an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor . Debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines, so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck, but the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother . Even a single stray nut or bolt, if sucked into one of the fighter plane's engines, could spell disaster for the pilot, and cause millions of dollars worth of damage. Usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects, using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up. But with 14,700sq ft of deck space to check and recheck every single day, the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother, and took a more direct approach. According to blog Foxtrot Alpha, the sailors have attached an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor, before fitting the front end with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the ship's deck. The vehicle is then driven up and down the 1,000ft-long deck, blowing all debris overboard. The massive Kuznetsov is the jewel in President Putin's military fleet, carrying a total of 18 fighter jets and 17 anti-submarine helicopters. The ingenious crew members fitted the old MiG engine with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the deck, and use the contraption like an enormous leaf blower, sending debris overboard . The Kuznetsov has a deck spanning 14,700sqft, so rather than search the entire thing by hand, Russian sailors built themselves a giant leaf-blowing machine instead . Bristling with anti-aircraft cannons, rocket batteries, gatling guns and underwater missiles, it weighs in at 43,000 tons and carries 1,690 crew. However, that is nothing compared to the US Nimitz Class aircraft carriers, the tenth and last of which, the George HW Bush, was commissioned in 2009. The ship weighs 102,000 tons, is powered by two on board nuclear reactors and is capable of carrying almost 6,000 crew and air company who pilot its 90 aircraft and helicopters. The UK's largest carrier in the HMS Queen Elizabeth, weighing in at 65,00 tonnes, it carries 40 jets and helicopters, along with 1,600 crew. The Kuznetsov is the largest carrier in the Russian Navy, built it 1985 it carries 18 fighter jets, 17 anti-submarine helicopters and 1,690 crew .","Debris on carriers can get sucked into jet engines, causing deadly crashes .

7652,"It was ten minutes short of 1am when Javier Hernandez left the Santiago Bernabeu last night. He did so beaming from ear to ear, admitting that he had seen the tweets from his Manchester United team-mates congratulating him on scoring what he called ‘one of the most important goals of my life’. Not everyone had been as complimentary as Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney, with Sky pundit Thierry Henry criticizing him for not immediately running to Cristiano Ronaldo who played the ball to him for the goal. Javier Hernandez (left) scores to send Real Madrid into the Champions League semi-final . Hernandez struck in the 88th minute to send Madrid through and fierce rivals Atletico Madrid out . Marca (left) say Hernandez scored 'the goal of his life' while AS praises 'Chicharito' for winning the tie . To pick up on that and not on the out-pouring of elation is to not understand just how much the Mexican striker has toiled for the last two seasons desperate for a chance to do what he feels he does best – score big goals in big games. ‘It was a great assist [from Ronaldo]’ he said after the match once the adrenalin levels that sent him sprinting towards the Real Madrid supporters behind the stadium’s south goal, had subsided. Despite starting only seven of the fifty games Real Madrid have played this season Hernandez has wriggled his way into the affections of the club’s supporters much and on three occasions, he got himself into goalscoring positions on Wednesday night. With the first two opportunities he snatched at the chance – shooting woefully into the side netting in the first half with Ronaldo and Isco better placed, and pulling another shot across the face of the goal in the second period. But when he hit the target with the third opportunity the stadium responded. His name echoed around all four sides of the ground and that is not something afforded lightly to any player in their first campaign. There was nothing special about the finish but getting there, to apply it when for the previous 88 minutes he had run himself into the ground does deserve credit and he had around 80,000 spectators wanting to thank him personally at the end. Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) provided a splendid assist for Hernandez's goal in the Champions League . Hernandez celebrates Madrid's victory with team-mate Ronaldo after the final whistle . Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick led the tributes to Hernandez on Twitter after the game . The Spanish radio journalists who mobbed him as he emerged from some post-match physiotherapy, all wanted to ask him about the last great Mexican striker to wear the white shirt, Hugo Sanchez. With a goals-per-minutes ratio that is better than Karim Benzema’s, there are even claims he should be starting more games. He replaced the Frenchman last night because of a knee injury that may yet sideline him for another couple of games. Once the euphoria of a last gasp winner subsides, Benzema’s extra quality has to be recognized and ‘El Chicharito’s’ place will eventually be back on the bench. In the longer-term he could satisfy himself in the knowledge that injuries will always present him with chances like last night. But he wants to be playing regularly and that will mean at the end of the season, when he returns to United, it will be to seek a new permanent deal elsewhere. ‘He has suffered’ said Carlo Ancelotti after the game. ‘He deserved the goal because he has never given in. He always trains well and he always gives everything when he plays. It’s a great reward for him.’ Had the 88th minute strike not come and Atletico held on to win on penalties, Ancelotti would have been criticized for his faith in the Mexican and the ‘Little Pea’ might have played his last minutes for Madrid with only the league left to contest. Some believe Hernandez should start more often ahead of Karim Benzema, who currently has a knee injury . Hernandez missed a couple of chances before scoring, but his persistence eventually paid off for Madrid . Real's players celebrate after Hernandez's late goal secured progress to the Champions League semi-final . As it is Madrid still have nine games to play and he will play his part. He has already written himself a little piece of Madrid history and reminded everyone what he can do. No wonder he ran straight to supporters to wildly celebrate; no wonder he didn’t want to leave the stadium last night.","Javier Hernandez got Real Madrid's Champions League winner against Atletico Madrid .

9183,"United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. United Launch Alliance has unveiled a radical plans for reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' that is slated to take off in 2019.  Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres . The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. Russian-made RD-180 engines currently power ULA's Atlas rocket, but Congress banned further imports as part of trade sanctions enacted after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. ULA said the new rocket's first stage will be powered by a pair of liquid-oxygen and liquefied methane engines under development by Blue Origin. Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno told a news conference in Colorado that the engines will be designed to return to Earth, so they can be refurbished and reflown. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to grab them mid-air . Reusing the engines will enable ULA to cut launch costs to about $100 million for a medium-lift booster and about $200 million for heavy-lift variants. This is roughly half the cost of ULA's current Delta 4 Heavy rocket. Initially, ULA will use its existing upper-stage Centaur engine but plans to introduce in 2023 an advanced motor that can recycle waste propellants. Hours after unveiling its next-generation 'Vulcan' rocket,  United Launch Alliance (ULA), ran into its first problem - the rocket's name. 'Vulcan is a trademark of Vulcan Inc. and we have informed ULA of our trademark rights,' Chuck Beames, president of the Paul Allen-backed Vulcan Aerospace, told Reuters. 'Paul Allen and Vulcan were early leaders within space exploration with the launch of SpaceShipOne more than a decade ago. We are flattered by ULA's tribute to our legacy by naming their new rocket 'Vulcan',' Beames said. ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, selected Vulcan as the name of its new booster, which will be developed in phases beginning in 2019, after it won more than 1 million votes in a crowdsourcing initiative. 'We have done our due diligence regarding the legal right to use the name Vulcan,' ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye wrote in an email. 'ULA is committed to taking every reasonable step to avoid any confusion with other entities using this name and we are confident we can do so,' she said. This, it claims, will greatly extend its orbital lifetime and the number of missions it can perform. 'We can take multiple satellites into orbit. We can put them in different planes,' Bruno said. 'When we get done with that, we can fly back to the space station. We can do all sorts of things. This is truly a game-changer.' ULA also plans to reduce its launch pads from five to two, and offer a standardised menu of fixed launch prices, much like SpaceX, which posts its Falcon rocket pricing on its website. Bruno declined to say how much Vulcan's development will cost, but added such efforts typically run at least $2 billion. ULA will use its own profits to bankroll the venture. SpaceX, meanwhile, is also hoping to transform the rocket business. Today, it attempted to land the first-stage booster of a Falcon 9 rocket on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. The attempt didn't go to plan, with the rocket booster tipped over after landing. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks an important step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. SpaceX founder, Elon Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. SpaceX is also hoping to transform the rocket business. Today, it attempted to land the first-stage booster of a Falcon 9 rocket on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth .","Vulcan plans to use new engines, mid-air recovery and new upper stage .

9951,"Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday brought back bitter memories of their disastrous 2014 World Cup, but coach Vicente del Bosque will not be too worried about a third straight friendly defeat, insists Gerard Pique. Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team.

2220,"Michael Scott Shemansky is on the run after authorities named him as a suspect in the murder of his mother . A Florida man wanted as a suspect in the murder of his own mother has been on the run from police since Saturday. Police say Michael Scott Shemansky came to their attention after he failed to appear for a supervised visit with his son on the same day mother Sandra Shemansky, 57, was found dead at the home they shared in Winter Garden. The body was discovered at the West Colonial Drive home when an out-of-state family member called in a well-being check. WKMG reports that an initial investigation determined there was foul play. 'My biggest concern is that he might come back,' said neighbor Natalie Randall, a resident of the Winter Garden RV Resort. An attorney for his estranged wife confirmed Shemansky's failure to appear for the scheduled visit. He is already on parole for battery on law enforcement, has a history of bipolar mental illness, and was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for an attempted suicide. His mother was there to help him as he went through a divorce. His wife filed a domestic violence injunction against him two years ago, according to her attorney, Diana Knowles Dunlop. Neighbors said his mother may have been the one preventing him from making the meeting with his son. Neighbors at the Winter Garden RV Resort believe divorce proceedings may have pushed Shemansky over the edge . 'His mom wouldn't allow him to go,' Nathan Tanner told reporters. 'She said because she didn't want him to have no more trouble through the courts.' Tanner added the stress of the divorce proceedings may have pushed him over the edge. 'And he got some paperwork Friday that was, I guess, bad news and I guess that triggered him,' Tanner told WFTV. Authorities have the murder weapon, still not publicly identified, but will not yet confirm how Sandra Shemansky was killed, according to information given to local press by Police Lt. Scott Allen. He allegedly was seen going into the trailer park's office and asking for a glass of water shortly after the murder. Shemansky was last seen fleeing on foot without any sort of provisions and no medication. His estranged wife is reportedly preparing to protect himself on the chance he arrives at her home. Anyone with information as to his whereabouts is urged to contact authorities at 407-656-3636.","Police say Michael Scott Shemansky came to their attention after he failed to appear for a supervised visit with his son Saturday .

10765,"The Secret Service will have to drive Scooby One and Scooby Two back to Chappaqua without HIllary Clinton riding shotgun. Instead, she's flying coach and toting her own luggage. A United Airlines regional jet carried her back to the East Coast on Thursday from the Omaha, Nebraska airport. Her flight was bound for Newark, New Jersey, the major airport most convenient to her spacious Chappaqua, New York home. A reporter with the liberal news outlet Vox tweeted a photo of Clinton toting her own luggage on Thursday in Omaha . SHE'S JUST LIKE US? A Town Car sedan (right) met Mrs. Clinton on the tarmac in Newark on Thursday, flanked by police and Secret Service vehicles . Hillary Clinton took the fast route home from Iowa to the East Coast: just a 3-hour flight instead of 20 hours of driving time . Clinton had just finished a three-day presidential campaign swing in Council Bluffs, Iowa. That's just a few miles away, and home to a cafe where she held a top-secret meeting with Democratic Party insiders who were told to surrender their cell phones and cameras beforehand. In contrast with the private jet service Hillary has been accustomed to on her storied and lucrative speaking tours, her ride home was a no-frills commercial flight without a First Class seat to be found anywhere. For flights from Omaha to Newark, United uses Embraer ERJ-135 and ERJ-145 jets with nothing but narrow economy-class seats. END OF AN ERA? Scooby's first trip ended with a total of 10 confirmed sightings and more than 1,300 miles driven . Clinton flew back East on an EMbraer ERJ-series plane like this one . EASIER TO RUB ELBOWS: The aircraft Mrs. Clinton took home has narrow chairs and the whole plane is economy class, but at least there's no middle seat . Hillary's handlers have been trying to reposition her as an 'everywoman' eager to meet with ordinary people. But her first Iowa event, promoted as a spontaneous coffee shop sit-down with average voters, turned out to be a carefully staged production whose young participants were driven to the cafe by Clinton's Iowa political director. At least three of the 'everyday Americans' featured in Hillary's campaign launch video have ties to Democratic Party politics. And hours before her flight, Secret Service agents parked the now-familiar 'Scooby' van in a handicapped spot so she would have a shorter walk. On Thursday a Vox reporter photographed Hillary at Omaha's Eppley Field airport, holding on to her own rollaboard luggage and talking with a member of the public. But while she boarded the plane like everyone else, she didn't disembark that way: Afellow passenger tweeted a photo of the Town Car sedan – and police escort – that awaited her in Newark on the airport tarmac. Just one person tweeted that Clinton was on their plane, not unlike her Ohio lunch at Chipotle where no one recognized her . EMBARRASSING: U.S. Secret Service parked 'Scooby' in a handicapped space Thursday while Clinton held a top-secret meeting with Democratic Party officials . It's not clear how Clinton's twin 'Scooby' vans, her armored and customized campaign vehicles, will get back to Chappaqua. The Secret Service did not respond to a request for comment. Agents will likely have to drive the vehicles back themselves. If Hillary were the American president, they would be rolled aboard Air Force One and flown east. But that will have to wait at least until January 2017.","United flight 3954 carried Clinton from Omaha, Nebraska to Newark, New Jersey on Thursday .

But the Gunners still finished in fourth place yet again, with Arsene Wenger's team were heavily criticised after throwing away the title. That poor run of form in 2014 couldn't seem further away now with Arsenal flying in the league, a recent 4-1 victory against Liverpool demonstrating their step forward.

7565,"A Russian military analyst has said that his country should develop weapons that can cause a nightmare scenario of tsunamis and volcano eruptions in the US, potentially killing hundreds of millions. Konstantin Sivkov, who writes a column for the Military-Industrial Courier, wrote earlier this month  that Russia needed new 'megaweapons' to unleash chaos and guarantee destruction of its enemies. In an article titled 'Nuclear Special Forces' he said that Russia should develop nuclear weapons manned by a small force that can cause tsunamis on the US coasts and force a volcano in Yellowstone National Park to erupt. Scroll down for video . Konstantin Sivkov, a Russian military analyst, has said that his country needs to develop a new nuclear deterrent against the US . Sivkov wrote a column in the Military-Industrial Courier that Russian should develop a small force of megaweapons  that can cause tsunamis and seismic activity at Yellowstone National Park (pictured) He said that the main objective of the new system would serve as an asymmetric threat against the US, which is 'moving to the borders or Russia' Sivkov headlines sections of his article with headers such as 'Specifications for Megaweapons', 'One Day Without America,' 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'The Apocalypse- Simply and Cheaply' The Russian analyst reasoned that because 80 per cent US population lives near the coast, generating tsunamis on the San Andreas fault and in the Atlantic would be an effective way of causing massive damage to 240 million people. He references Hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans and says that detonating nuclear bombs near the bottom of the ocean would create waves almost a mile high that would sweep inland. The military man says that all the seismic activity could release another wave that would wipe out the US's European allies. Sivkov, the president of the Academy of Geopolitical Problems, says that Russia's large inland territory in Siberia will protect it from receiving too much harm. He raises the stakes for the apocalyptic scenario even further by saying that the tsunami could trigger the Yellowstone Caldera, a supervolcano that last exploded 640,000 years ago. Triggering the Yellowstone Caldera, which hasn't erupted in 640,000 years, would spread ash across the country. Above, a map from the United States Geological Survey predicts the amount of ash from the blast . Sivkov says that triggering the supervolcano at Yellowstone would cover most of the US in ash and serve as an asymmetric weapon. Above, Mammoth Hot Springs at the park . The explosion would then unleash  feet of volcanic ash over all of the United States. According to Sivkov, Russia could also trigger just the volcano with a 'relatively small' megaton blast because it has shown signs of activity. Sivkov said that the normal nuclear deterrent was not good enough and too expensive given Russia's economic problems. While he is convinced of his idea, it remains to be seen if the tsunami and the litany of destruction that followed would be even be possible if the world came to nuclear war. The journal that the analyst writes for is a niche publication with less than 2,000 fans on the Russian social network VKontakte. He may not have the ear of President Vladimir Putin, but Sivkov has a history of making attention-grabbing statements about Russian military affairs for state-backed media. Sivkov said that his new nuclear deterrent idea could be deployed from one ship and could be ready within ten years. He has  imagined potential war between the US and Russia before, telling the pro-Kremlin Independent Newspaper that military games in eastern Russian north of Japan were 'intended to simulate a response to a hypothetical attack by Japanese and US forces.' His other articles in VPK repeatedly call for bigger and more powerful weapons for the Russian military and he has bemoaned Russia's lack of military spending compared to the US, according to the Moscow Times. Sivkov said that detonating nuclear bombs on the ocean floor could generate deadly tsunamis and cause massive damage to the US population. Above, devastation after the 2011 tsunami that hit Japan . State-run television presenter Dmitry Kiselyov (pictured receiving an award at the Kremlin) said last year that  Russia is 'the only country in the world capable of turning the USA into radioactive dust' Russians' once positive views of America have slid sharply since the beginning of rising tensions between Moscow and Washington over Syria and Ukraine. In January 81 per cent of residents said they had a very bad or generally bad view of the US. Imagining America turned to ashes is a frightening thought, though Sivkov's article was not the first time that it had been floated recently in Russia. During the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis and Russia's annexation of Crimea, state-run television presenter Dmitry Kiselyov said that President Obama's gray hair was because of worries about Russian nuclear weapons. He said that Russia was 'the only country in the world capable of turning the USA into radioactive dust.'","Konstantin Sivkov wrote that Russia needs a new 'asymmetric' weapon .

10582,"The mother of Nicholas Figueroa, a 23-year-old male model who died in a building explosion on New York City's 2nd Avenue last month, has spoken out . Ana Figueroa, 55, told Daily Mail Online that though she cries every night, those responsible for the explosion and handling its aftermath have not reached out to her. 'Nobody's spoken to me, no one has called to give condolences,' she said at a memorial to her son that was set up Thursday at the site of the disaster that killed two and destroyed three buildings on March 26. Scroll down for video . Ana Figueroa (pictured with husband Nixon) has spoken out for the first time since her son Nicholas, 23, died in a gas explosion on New York City's Second Avenue . The young man and recent college graduate was paying the bill on a blind date at a sushi restaurant when three buildings in New York's East Village were destroyed . Her Upper East Side family, which includes Nicholas's father Nixon, 52, and his three younger brothers Brandon, Neal and Tyler, says it still 'wants justice' and those responsible for the explosion to be punished. However, nearly one month after the blast that killed Nicholas when he was on a blind date at a sushi bar, answers about what exactly happened in the explosion remain unclear. In early April, according to the New York Post, a plumber allegedly admitted to law enforcement that he created an illegal gas connection in the building. allegedly at the request of Michael Hyrnenko, the son of landlord Maria Hyrnenko. Mrs Figueroa said that she had not been contacted by Ms Hyrnenko and has only learned about her life after reading it in media reports. She has learned that Ms Hyrnenko is also 55 and also has four children and said Thusday, 'I wonder how she would feel if she were to lose her kid'. While he said that they didn't want to 'blame' anyone, Mr Figueroa said that the family 'wants someone to come forward and say that they did this'. Nicholas's mother, who has not previously spoken at length to the press, said she had contacted a lawyer about filing charges against the landlord, though she is waiting until after the results of the city's investigation. The Figueroas say that neither the landlord of the demolished buildings, Mayor Bill de Blasio nor Con Edison have contacted them with condolences following their loss . The family, who are afraid that their son's death and its cause will be 'put under the rug' have set up a memorial at the site of the explosion . Mrs Figueroa, who was hugged by passersby who saw the memorial to her son, said that she still cries every night . A wall has been placed around the site of the explosion, which destroyed buildings at the corner of Second Avenue and Seventh Street and damaged windows on one adjacent . Attempts by Daily Mail Online to contact Mrs Hyrnenko, who switched lawyers after the explosion, for comment were unsuccessful. Beyond Ms Hyrnenko, the Figueroa family said that other parties such as utility company Con Edison and the owner of Sushi Park, where Nicholas was eating when he died, bear some responsibility for his death. Mrs Figueroa faulted them for not stopping gas flow to the building and continuing to run a restaurant in a dangerous situation. 'Everybody has a part of this', Nixon Figueroa said Thursday. Now the Figueroas are left with their son and brother's death as the story fades from headlines, and the feeling that swiftly finding the person responsible is not a priority for authorities. 'They're going to say ''It's only two lives, it could have been more'', but it was my son', Mrs Figueroa said on Thursday as passersby hugged her in consolation. The explosion resulted in the deaths of Nicholas and Moises Locon, 26, a busboy at Sushi Park. Her family was last contacted by New York City authorities before the April 7 funeral for Nicholas, when help with services were offered. A GoFundMe page in memory of Nicholas met it's $30,000 goal, and the Figueroas did not take the city's help. Despite the relatively small number of victims, Mrs Figueroa said that she had not received a phone call from Mayor Bill de Blasio. 'We're nobody,' she said. 'Now I really need their help if we don't want this to be pushed under the rug'. A spokesman for the Mayor released a statement to Daily Mail Online saying: 'Following the East Village building collapse members of the administration were in regular communication with the families of the victims . 'Additionally, the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City raised more than $150,000 for the victims of the tragedy and the administration's offer to assist with funeral arrangements was declined.' Nicholas Figueroa, (left) a former model, and Moises Locon, 26 (right), both died at Sushi Park restaurant . New York City officials offered to help pay for Nicholas's funeral in early April, though the family was able to pay for it with help from a GoFundMe page . Mrs Figueroa was in tears at the funeral as she held a red rose and wore a button remembering her oldest son . Though the memorial set up on Thursday is a sorrowful reminder of her family's loss, the mother says that her sadness has mixed with anger over fears that her son will have 'died in vain' and no one will be held responsible. Ms Figueroa referenced other New York City incidents such as a crane collapse in 2008 that killed two and a fire in 2010 where those judged responsible faced manslaughter charges. The owner of the crane company and three men connected to the 2010 fire were all acquitted. She knows that the odds of a criminal conviction are small, but hopes that those responsible will help establish a small park on the property in memory of her son, who loved nature and meditating. The grieving mother said that those responsible include Con Edison, the utilities giant that said part of the building's gas works failed inspection about an hour before the explosion. She has also yet to be contacted by officials from the company. Con Ed released a statement to Daily Mail Online saying: 'We said on the day of the explosion and since then, that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this tragedy, and we made a significant contribution to the Mayor's Fund to help those affected.' Ms Hyrnenko's building had previously failed a Con Ed inspection in August, when workers discovered that a pipe had been tapped in a dangerous way, the company told the New York Times. Mrs Figueroa said that illegal gas tapping should not be a 'three strike' policy and that gas to the building should have been shut off completely following the second failed inspection. A Con Edison spokesman told Daily Mail Online that the March 26 inspection was on 'work the building owner was doing in connection with the installation of a new service'. The spokesman said 'The work did not pass the inspection and our inspectors left. The new service was locked, meaning that gas could not be accessed by it.' A plumber allegedly admitted to law enforcement earlier this month that he had created an illegal gas connection at the site of the explosion . Smoke from the fire was visible from around New York City as firefighters worked to combat the blaze on March 26 . The investigation into the incident by police and fire authorities is ongoing, with much of the suspicion falling on the buildings' gasworks . Con Edison has previously said that it was replacing a small pipe with a larger one that would allow both the building residents and the sushi restaurant to receive gas. Restaurant owner Hyeonil Kim told the New York Times he believed that the residents had been getting gas since the summer from a pipe coming from Ms Hyrnenko's other building next door. Gas is thought to have still been flowing through the old piping after the inspectors left. After the inspectors left, Ms Hrynenko's son Michael was down in the basement investigating a gas leak during the explosion. He was carried out by a general contractor with him. 'Our understanding is that the criminal investigation continues,' the company said in a statement. For now the mother is left with only pictures and messages from her son. Her last texts from Nicholas, with whom she would talk about 'everything' including  include message where he asks her to cook his favorite chicken for dinner. The young man had just gotten his bachelor's from Buffalo State College and had been home for three months before he died. Right before meeting his blind date at Sushi Park, Nicholas, a former model, had texted that he was about to have an 'interesting experience'. Ms Figueroa did not hear from her son again, and was knew that he was in the blast when she saw that his debit card had been used at the restaurant right before the explosion. After spending a long night at a nearby school hoping that her son would be found in the wreckage, Mrs Figueroa was later shown the place where he died. While the family may worry that officials will forget about their son's death, she is grateful for public support. Visitors to the Second Avenue memorial can now read testaments to the loving brother and son and see the spot where the explosion took his life, which the family has marked with white roses.

2928,"Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.","Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, has been arrested .

8555,"(CNN)The racist and offensive emails that resulted in three Ferguson, Missouri, city employees either resigning or being fired have been released. The exchanges between the city's top court clerk and two police officers were discovered during a U.S. Justice Department investigation of racial prejudice in the city's police and judicial system. The emails -- which make offensive references to President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama as well as Muslims and minorities --  were obtained by the Washington Post on Thursday after a public records request. CNN reviewed them Friday. Police Capt. Rick Henke and Sgt. William Mudd resigned early last month after the emails were discovered as part of the evidence in the Justice Department's scathing Ferguson report. The city's top court clerk, Mary Ann Twitty, was fired in connection with the emails, officials said. One email showed Ronald Reagan, an actor before becoming President, feeding a chimp in the 1951 comedy ""Bedtime for Bonzo,"" with the caption: ""Rare photo of Ronald Reagan babysitting Barack Obama in 1962."" Another showed a photo of bare-chested dancing women, apparently in Africa, with the caption ""Michelle Obama's High School Reunion!"" A June 2011 email described a man trying to put his dogs on welfare because the canines were ""mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English and have no ... clue who their Daddies are."" Some critics have called for the department to be disbanded. Last month, embattled Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned one week after the scathing Justice Department report slammed his department. Jackson will receive a severance payment and health insurance for one year, city officials said. Opinion: Change is coming to Ferguson . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered the Ferguson police investigation after a white police officer, Darren Wilson, shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown last summer, setting off months of sometimes violent street protests in the town outside St. Louis. The DOJ declined to bring charges against Wilson, who has since left the force. No state charges were filed. In a separate report, the Justice Department described what it said was a ""pattern and practice"" of discrimination against African-Americans by the Ferguson police and municipal courts. That discrimination included racist emails. Ferguson is a town of 21,000 that is 67% African-American. Among the findings in the report: . From 2012 to 2014, 85% of people subject to vehicle stops by Ferguson police were African-American, 90% of those who received citations were blac and 93% of people arrested were black. In 88% of the cases in which Ferguson police officers reported using force, it was against African-Americans. From 2012-2014 black drivers were twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during traffic stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband.

1543,"A New York City cop checking in on his elderly parents on Friday was horrified to discover them dead along with two other guests in their home. Robert Hugel, who is assigned to the Technical Assistance Response Unit, found the victims, all in their 70s and 80s, just after 3 p.m. at the house in Bellerose in Floral Park, Queens. The New York Post reports that Jerry Hugel, 83, his wife Marianne Hugel, 80, died along with 70-year-old neighbor Gloria Greco, and friend Walter Vondthadden, 76, in an apparent carbon monoxide poisoning, possibly caused by a car left running in a garage. Scroll down for video . Married 60 years: Neighbors say that Jerry and Marrianne Hugel were a happily married couple for 60 years who loved to dance, garden, and observe their German heritage . Cleaning up: Police Department personnel remove one of the bodies from a home where four people were found dead on Friday . It appeared the car was accidentally left running in the garage, but it was unclear for how long, investigators said. Neighbors lined the streets and sidewalks in the suburban neighborhood next to Long Island's Nassau County. Some cried as police officers and firefighters walked around the Cape Cod-style, two-story home. Before police officially identified the victims, neighbor Helga Harter told The Associated Press that the couple was named Jerry Hugel and Marie Hugel, who were in their 80s and had known her for 40 years. 'They were wonderful people,' Harter said through tears as she stood on a street corner, looking at the home. 'They were married for 60 years.' Heartbroken son: Robert Hugel was checking in on his elderly parents on Friday when he found them dead due to apparent carbon monoxide poisoning along with two of their friends . Medical aid: Emergency personnel gather near a home where police say four people were poisoned to death . The Hugels had five children, including son Robert Hugel, a New York Police Department officer who was said to have found his parents lifeless bodies. She described them as a 'great family' very active in the local German community. She last saw them on Wednesday at a Bavarian dancing class they attended together. 'I'm in shock,' Harter said. 'It's the greatest shock of my life.' The Hugels had lived in the home for 40 years, and an elderly woman lived upstairs as their tenant, Harter said. No visible trauma was observed on the victims' bodies, police said. Carbon monoxide, an odorless and colorless gas, is created when some fuels are burned. Hugel was found in the seat of his car in the garage and his wife was found in the room directly next to the garage, reports The New York Post. The scene:  Police stand outside the floral park home where four elderly people were found dead and where to windows are now wide open in an attempt to ventilate the apparent fume filled house . The couple’s friend, age 73, had been seated in the living room and the tenant, who sources said was older than 60, was found on the second floor at the top of the stairs. Neighbors were heartbroken after hearing about the deaths. 'It looks like it was accident, someone just forgot to turn the car off,' a source told The New York Daily News. 'The windows were air-tight, so there was nowhere for the gas to go.' 'It is very surreal,' said Barbara Stoja. 'We knew them for over 35 years. They were very fun people, they were dancers.' 'This is something you see on TV. It is so sad we all know each other to know he is not going to be there anymore.' Stoja said that Jerry Hugel was an avid gardener.

The dog named Teeny is captured on video sat opposite Eric Ko – a trainer with over ten years’ experience – of the Dogaroo centre in Hong Kong. The pair hold onto push-up bars with their front paws and hands respectively and wait for the trainer's command before getting into position. Looking up at Eric in excitement, the dog waits for the trainer to say ‘one’ and complete a press-up before following suit and completing one of its own. On ‘two’ the pair return to their original position before Eric says ‘three’ and ‘four’ and the dog reaches out to high-five him with both paws. Eric then says ‘kiss’ and the dog leans towards him and gives him a quick peck on the lips before the pair begin the routine again. The dog looks up at the trainer in excitement and waits for him to say 'one' before starting .

4257,"(CNN)Three Orthodox rabbis accused of planning and participating in the torture of Jewish men who refused to divorce their wives were convicted Tuesday of conspiring to commit kidnapping. Rabbis Mendel Epstein, 69; Jay Goldstein, 60; and Binyamin Stimler, 39, were found guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in New Jersey federal court. Goldstein and Stimler were also convicted on charges of attempted kidnapping. The rabbis were part of a ring accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars to orchestrate the kidnappings of Jewish husbands to persuade them through torture involving electric cattle prods and screwdrivers to grant ""gets,"" a document that Jewish law requires a husband to present to his wife in order to be issued a divorce, court papers said. The men were arrested in October 2013 following an FBI sting operation that ended with Goldstein, Stimler and six other men with ski masks, surgical blades and a 30-foot nylon rope in a warehouse in Middlesex County, New Jersey. Lawyers for each of the rabbis told CNN they plan on appealing the convictions. ""Rabbi Epstein still firmly believes that he was protecting women's rights and was protecting the agunahs and the families,"" said Robert Stahl, the lawyer for Epstein. Without a ""get,"" a woman is considered an ""agunah,"" a chained woman bound to a man no matter how over the marriage might actually be. An Orthodox Jewish woman who does not receive a get runs the risk of being shunned in her community and labeled an adulteress if she moves on. Any future children she has are considered bastards permitted to marry only other bastards. ""I don't think this was a traditional kidnapping,"" said Aidan O'Connor, the lawyer for Goldstein. Goldstein is a sofer, a Jewish scribe who transcribes the Torah and writes other religious documents, including divorce papers, his attorney said. Nathan Lewin, the attorney for Stimler, called the verdict ""shocking"" and said his client was only present at the warehouse as a witness for the ceremonial signing of the document. ""There's no evidence that Rabbi Stimler knew what was going to be going on,"" Lewin said. ""Of course we're going to take all the steps to correct this injustice."" Epstein's son, David Epstein, was acquitted on Tuesday of kidnapping charges. The jury returned not guilty verdicts on the attempted kidnapping charges against Mendel Epstein, and on more severe kidnapping charges against the three rabbis. Nine other individuals previously pled guilty in the case to conspiracy charges, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey. Henry Mazurek, the lawyer for David Epstein, said his client was grateful for the jury's decision but called his client's acquittals ""bittersweet"" next to his father's conviction. ""He really believes that (his father) was a champion of someone who was voiceless in his religion,"" Mazurek said. Sentencing is set for July 15. The men face up to life in prison.","Three rabbis found guilty of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in New Jersey federal court .

4670,"Down Augusta way they say the azaleas are in full bloom, which is more than can be said for England’s Justin Rose. A bruising Florida swing last month saw the Englishman fall outside the world’s top 10. For a player who has been virtually a fixture in the top five for the last three years it was certainly a dent to the ego, with the Masters now just around the corner. Rose’s solution to his miserable form — three missed cuts and a 55th-place finish at the Cadillac Championship in four PGA Tour starts — was the time-honoured one. For the past two weeks, the 34-year-old has spent long hours on the practice ground. Justin Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 at the Shell Houston Open . In the first round of the Shell Houston Open on Thursday there were encouraging signs his decline will prove temporary. Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69, the same score as his playing partner, the ever- consistent Jordan Spieth. ‘It’s certainly a welcome return to the sixties, for it had been a while,’ said Rose, smiling. On a day when American Scott Piercy went round in 63 and Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66, it was hardly surprising the only reporter waiting to talk to Rose was this one. But under the radar is never a bad place to be going to the Masters. The boom and bust years that characterised the first half of Rose’s career meant there was never going to be any feelings of panic following his unusually poor run in the Sunshine State. ‘There’s no doubt I lost my game there but the Florida swing can be unforgiving if you’re slightly off,’ he said. ‘Over the past two weeks I feel like I’ve done some good work and whether I finish well or not here I feel like I’m going in the right direction again. ‘Basically I was getting ahead of the ball at impact, and shots were going left or right, the irons were not solid and the new putter was not working. So we’ve corrected the faults and I’ve gone back to the old putter.’ Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on Thursday . Does he pay much attention to the world rankings? ‘You notice, for sure,’ he said. ‘I’m very proud of the fact I’ve been in the world’s top five for practically the whole of the last three years. It’s a nice ego thing, so by the end of the year I’m hoping there won’t be any slippage. ‘But right now, I’ve got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you’re playing well. I’m in all the tournaments I want to be in, so there’s no need to worry on that score. Typically, your good years are built around four or five really good weeks, so you have to stay patient.’ He’d certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one. Rose paid a reconnaissance visit to Augusta last Monday and felt the same old thrill. ‘It’s such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet, you still pinch yourself,’ he said. ‘I think if I’d had a crystal ball when I was 13 or 14 and it had said I’d get to play Augusta every year, I’d have been very happy with that.’ He’s certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date. Rose might be the only player in Masters history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one. His best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007, when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double-bogey six. Paul Casey celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68 . ‘The Masters has probably been less on my mind this year because I am trying to find some form,’ he admitted. ‘But I think the fact I’ve had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead. Regardless of what happens here, I feel comfortable on that course and know I can manage my game even if it’s not 100 per cent. You draw off the energy of the place.’ Mickelson has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty, a three-time Masters champion, is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket. ‘It was a good start to the tournament and now I’m looking for three more good rounds,’ he said. 'This is a big week for me. I felt the game was close last week. The only thing missing was chipping and short game.' Paul Casey, like Mickelson another former winner of this event, celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes. In the afternoon wave, Padraig Harrington and Lee Westwood both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under.","Justin Rose bounced back from Florida misery by carding 69 in Houston .

4982,"Dozens more company bosses have signed a letter backing Tory economic plans – including a prominent former Labour supporter. By last night, a total of 150 business leaders have signed the letter warning against a ‘change in course’. Among the new signatories is Simon Woodroffe, the founder of Yo! Sushi and a former Labour backer. Dozens more company bosses have signed a letter backing Tory economic plans – including prominent former Labour supporter Simon Woodroffe, the founder of Yo! Sushi . Others also include executives from two FTSE-100 firms and 10 from the FTSE-250 index. Adding their names were Philip Aiken, the chairman of construction giant Balfour Beatty, Dr Tom Enders, boss of Airbus, and Simon Litherland, head of drinks group Britvic. All have signed in a personal capacity. The announcement of the new names will heap pressure on Labour, which has struggled to come forward with notable numbers of business supporters. Once a former prominent Labour supporter, Mr Woodroffe appears to have turned his back on the party despite appearing in a 2004 political broadcast. Earlier this year, he warned that Labour’s approach to business ‘scares’ him. He told BBC Newsnight: ‘What I worry about with Ed Miliband is that he is appealing to the popular by saying, “look at all these fat cats” making lots of money it should be for the workers.’ ‘Actually, I think the fat cats generally, sometimes it annoys me, but they pay their taxes, you know.’ By last night, a total of 150 business leaders have signed the letter warning against a ‘change in course’ The letter backs the lowering of corporation tax by David Cameron and George Osborne as it shows the UK is 'open for business' The letter states that the signatories believe the Conservative-led government ‘has been good for business and pursued policies which have supported investment and job creation’. They praise the cuts in corporation tax to 20 per cent, which they say is a ‘key part’ of the Tory economic plan. They add: ‘We believe a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment. This would send a negative message about Britain and put the recovery at risk.’ When the letter was first published in a newspaper last week it sent shockwaves through the election campaign. Labour attempted to respond by positioning itself as the party of workers. It announced plans to ban 90 per cent of zero hours contracts and make it easier for staff to sue their bosses for wrongful dismissal. A poll of FTSE-100 chairman at the weekend showed seven out of ten think Mr Miliband would be a ‘catastrophe’ for Britain. The anonymous poll, published by the Sunday Times, showed widespread concern by businesses about Labour’s economic plans.","Yo! Sushi founder Simon Woodroffe is among new signatories of letter .

6222,"An Old Bailey judge has blasted his junior colleague for ‘taking his eye off the ball’ and passing an 'unlawful' sentence when letting a BT manager dodge jail for a £28,000 expenses scam. Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners’ property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both Starrs and Tamplin, 53, who made £124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an ‘act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was ‘unlawful’ - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. ‘It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,’ he said. ‘He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn’t have his eye on the ball.’ The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: ‘The sentence was wrong but that’s a matter of personal opinion. ‘Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. ‘What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him. ‘No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. ‘I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don’t want this sort of thing.’ Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of £28,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: ‘This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can’t do. ‘The judge should have been told what his powers were.’ Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a ‘blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: ‘He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.’ Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been ‘clamped’ by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around £1million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. ‘It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. ‘Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. ‘You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.’ Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.","Christopher Starrs was spared jail in an 'act of mercy' by judge in January .

In the past, the Argentine has spoken out against the idea of summer tours in long haul destinations.

7814,"(CNN)The greater adjutant stork is a majestic bird. Standing about 5 feet tall with an average wingspan of 8 feet, it soars over the Boragaon landfill like a great protector. It knows the residents and shies away from strangers. ""They are intelligent birds. Every time I got close to them they would fly away,"" photographer Timothy Bouldry said. The dirty, wet conditions of the landfill attracted the endangered stork, and the stork attracted Bouldry. Through a series of photos taken within a day, he captures what it's like to live inside one of the largest dumping grounds in India. The Boragaon landfill is located in the city of Guwahati, about 300 miles from Bangladesh near the Bhutanese border. It's 94 acres of mostly fresh waste, surrounded by swamplands. (Other landfills, Bouldry says, contain older, compacted trash.) For the past seven years, Bouldry has traveled the world photographing landfills. He's visited places such as Haiti, Venezuela and Colombia. The greater adjutant stork initially drew Bouldry to Boragaon, but he became connected with the people. About 100 families live inside the Boragaon landfill. Every day, they search the area for treasure -- a tiny scrap of metal, a bit of plastic, maybe a bone. They use large hooks to sort through the garbage, which sometimes reaches two or three stories high. They work in teams, and more than often they are barefoot. ""They don't look at the things they're doing as being unsanitary or unhealthy or unsafe,"" Bouldry said. They collect plastic, metal and wires and sell it by the pound. The families make around $2 per day. Their homes are constructed by recycled materials, with sometimes several families living in one shanty at a time. With no electricity, no running water -- and an overabundance of trash -- they are experts at repurposing. ""You might see a refrigerator being used as a closet,"" he said. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Some of the children living in Boragaon go to school on scholarship, but most of them work in the landfill to provide for their families. But don't be deceived: The people living here feel anything but destitute. Bouldry uses words such as ""love,"" ""hope"" and ""spirituality"" to describe them. ""I found that the landfill community is content,"" Bouldry said. ""They are not jaded by modern civilization."" Bouldry lives and works inside the La Chureca landfill in Nicaragua, one of the largest landfills in the world. He helps the people living there grow gardens fertilized with compost he makes with organic waste from local smoothie shops. In addition to his photography, he teaches English and yoga classes a few times per week. But why? Bouldry went to art school in Boston. He's no stranger to sophisticated civilization. He said he found humanitarian photo projects to be the most fulfilling, and he became especially intrigued by landfills even though they are ""scary, dirty and kind of grotesque.""

7030,"A college sophomore who died of excessive alcohol consumption drank a 60-ounce bottle of vodka during what college officials said was the hazing of pledges at an unsanctioned fraternity, according to court papers filed in connection to the case. The documents were filed by two students who were expelled from the University at Albany after Trevor Duffy, 19, of the Bronx died in November. His death came after a night of heavy drinking during a party held by Zeta Beta Tau members at an off-campus home. A look at 461 Hamilton Street, the scene of an alleged underage drinking party . The two students want to return to the college reports The Times Union of Albany, as they were among the 24 sanctioned by the university after its investigation determined members of the underground frat were guilty of drug, alcohol and student group violations, as well as threatening and abusive behavior, endangerment, hazing and disruptive conduct, the newspaper reported. The university's investigation concluded Duffy's death was the result of hazing. No one has been arrested and Albany police said their investigation is continuing. Duffy died at an Albany hospital November 17, two days after drinking large amounts of alcohol with other frat pledges. Police said they went to the Albany home early on November 16 after someone called 911 to report an intoxicated man in need of medical assistance. Officers said Duffy and four other young men were taken to the hospital for treatment for excessive alcohol consumption. The other four men were treated and released. The court papers included details of other frat hazing rituals that included pledges being told to fight one another and eat the insides of cigars.","Trevor Duffy, a University of Albany fraternity pledge who died during hazing last November, drank a 60-ounce bottle of vodka .

3998,"An adorable orphaned wombat has found herself a new friend - and a very prickly pillow. Chloe the wombat, who first made headlines after her special bond with her surrogate zookeeper mum emerged last December, has found herself a new buddy at Taronga Zoo's grounds in Sydney after she moved into her new digs alongside a couple of echidnas. In an adorable video uploaded to Instagram by Taronga Zoo, Chloe is seen trying to take a nap in the mud on one of the echidnas. As she rolled over to snuggle up, the echidna moved away but Chloe still rested her eyes for a moment before getting up. Scroll down for video . Chloe the wombat has mistaken her new echidna friend for a pillow at Taronga Zoo . She recently moved into her new digs alongside a couple of echidnas who don't seem as eager to snuggle as she is . 'Chloe wasted no time making friends with her spiky new housemates and they've been busy digging in the soft dirt together,' Taronga Zoo said. When she's not napping, Chloe likes to follows her zoo keeper Evelyn Weston around the zoo. ‘It’s a natural behaviour and something Chloe would be doing with her real mother if she’d survived,’ Evelyn said. Adorable wombat Chloe is now one-year-old and lives at Taronga Zoo in Sydney . She has become zoo keeper Evelyn Weston's little helper and follows her around the zoo . ‘Wombats stay with their mothers for up to two years, walking by their side until they’re old enough to fend for themselves.’ The pair have been inseparable since Chloe came to the zoo three months ago after her mother was struck and killed by a car near Jenolan Caves, west of the Blue Mountains, in June 2014. Chloe stays by Evelyn’s side while she cleans out exhibits and prepares breakfast for the other animals during morning walks. She is fed by a bottle every five hours and has her own makeshift pouch. The pair have been inseparable since Chloe came to the zoo three months ago . Chloe's mum was killed by a car earlier this year and the joey was found in her pouch still alive . Chloe stays by Evelyn’s side while she cleans out exhibits . Her daily walks are part of her development before she can be safely released back into the wild. Keepers at the zoo have also built the joey a home where she can dig burrows and forage for her own food. ‘She’s really learning how to be a wombat. Her paws are already toughening up and she’s quite happy digging about on her own,’ said Evelyn. When the time comes for Chloe to be released back into the wild she will first be transferred to a wombat ‘halfway house’. But Evelyn admitted she’ll be a little sad to lose her. ‘I’ve been doing this job for a long time, but it’s always hard to say goodbye. I like to think I’ve toughened up, but sometimes I’m still a wuss,’ she said. ‘She’s really learning how to be a wombat,' zoo keeper Evelyn says .

Co-owner Rick Barclay acted after receiving a stop-work order last month when officials said they found equipment on site indicating operations inconsistent with standard mine development requirements. The miners have since appealed the order and spokesman, Kerby Jackson, confirmed paperwork had been filed to keep officials from 'burning or breaking anything' on the property - but gave no more details.

But Whittington said while the owners have mining rights, the surface rights were ceded to the BLM in 1961 by the then-owners.

2082,"Leeds president Massimo Cellino insists he had nothing to do with the events that led to six players pulling out of Saturday's match against Charlton. Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri, Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani withdrew from the squad on the eve of the trip to The Valley citing injuries, prompting some accusations that the players had gone 'on strike'. The club released a statement on Sunday evening looking to draw a line under the controversy which read: 'Leeds United Football Club wants to clarify that during the days leading up to the away Championship fixture at Charlton Athletic on Saturday April 17 that six first-team players suffered injuries.' Massimo Cellino insists he had nothing to do with the events that led to players pulling out of Saturday's match against Charlton . Mirco Antenucci was among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton . And Cellino, who has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, has now also distanced himself from any possible conspiracy theory, telling the Sun: 'I am not a coward and not the sort of guy who tells his players to go on strike. 'I only found out on Friday evening. I admit it looks weird. But if the players were injured, why didn't the manager inform the chairman? 'This looks like a fight between manager Neil Redfearn and the ownership of the club, which is not good.' Cellino's ban and the injury controversy are just two of a string of chaotic events that have plagued Leeds recently with Redfearn's position increasingly threatened over recent weeks . Giuseppe Bellusci, Antenucci and two other Italians were among those who made themselves unavailable . Redfearn has led the club to safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic, but he saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. The state of flux at Elland Road has led many fans to call for Cellino to leave the club altogether but the Italian insists he still wishes to take the Whites forward. 'From day one I felt I was at the right club, because I am more f****d up than the fans,' he said. 'I am 58 and my dream is still for us to do something big here. I have asked permission to go to our last game of the season against Rotherham, a day before my ban ends. Yoni Buyens celebrates scoring Charlton's second goal during his side's 2-1 victory against Leeds . The withdrawals, including Souleymane Doukara's, are the latest incident in another turbulent period at Leeds . 'If the fans want to kick me and shout at me, fine. I am used to it.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said. 'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'

6658,"A gun-wielding mother has been arrested after allegedly firing into a crowd of people outside an apartment complex in a bid to break up a fight - only for the bullet to hit and kill her teenage son. Latoya Tilson, 33, took out a .25-caliber handgun and fired several times into the feuding crowd in College Park, Georgia, on Saturday night after she was hit in the face by someone, police said. But while one bullet struck a 17-year-old boy in the buttocks, another hit Tilson's 15-year-old son, Pierre, in the head. Pierre had apparently been trying to protect his  sister, 13, from the other boy. When first responders arrived at the scene, the teenager was lying unconscious on the floor. He was not breathing and a bullet was lodged in his head. His mother had fled the scene, it is alleged. Scroll down for video .

One of the shots killed her 17-year-old son, Pierre (pictured) Pierre was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital with a gunshot wound to the back of his head. He remained in intensive care for two days, but despite medics' best efforts, he died on Monday. On Saturday night, Tilson was arrested on several charges, including aggravated assault and cruelty to children, after shocked witnesses told police she had seemingly accidentally shot her son. She is now expected to face upgraded charges following Pierre's death. The other shooting victim, who has not been named, is believed to have been successfully treated in hospital for his injury. During the incident outside the Godby Road apartment complex, where Tilson lived, Pierre was allegedly trying to protect his younger sister from the other boy when the situation escalated. 'The mother went out there allegedly to break it up,' Master Sergeant Jeff Hightower told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday, adding: 'During the altercation, someone hit her in the face.' Tilson then reportedly took out her small-caliber handgun and fired several shots into the crowd, accidentally striking Pierre, a freshman at Southwest DeKalb High School and a keen drummer.

He remained in intensive care for two days, but despite medics' best efforts, he died on Monday afternoon . First responders arrived at the scene in the 3100 block of Godby Road at around 8pm. They performed chest compressions on Pierre until EMS arrived and transported him to hospital. Speaking to WSB-TV before Pierre's death at 1.30pm on Monday, the victim's father, Wayne Jones, said he forgave Tilson for 'accidentally' shooting their son, adding that she was on suicide watch. 'She's very distraught at this point,' Jones said. 'If she's looking or listening, I forgive you.' Pierre and his sister reportedly lived with their father, but had been visiting their mother for the Easter weekend. Neighbors who heard the gunshots were shocked to hear Tilson had allegedly shot and killed her son, with many believing the mother should have reacted to the fight differently. One neighbor, Leslie Brooks, said: 'I just think its really sad. I just think there's another way that the situation could have been handled. Maybe the police could have been called a little sooner. 'It shocked the whole community. Because there are a lot of children out. There are a lot of parents. 'I'm a mother, so I can only imagine the devastation that she is feeling as well.' She added: 'But to pull out a gun, as a mother into a children's situation, I just think it's really sad.' Another, Stacey Marshall, who was at South Hampton Estates when the dispute broke out, told 11Alive: 'It wasn't on purpose at all. It was a mother trying to protect her kids, it just went wrong.'

11376,"An armed robber who held up a shop with a knife was caught because his own former mother-in-law was working behind the till. Kyle Iveson burst into a convenience store and demanded cash from shop assistant Karen Brown, the mother of his ex-girlfriend and grandmother of his daughter. He attempted to disguise his identity by lowering his voice, but she instantly recognised him and was able to report him to the police straight away. Scroll down for video . Caught: Robber Kyle Iveson, left, was apprehended by his own mother-in-law Karen Brown, right . CCTV images show Iveson, 24, taking a 12in knife into the Thorougoods shop in Clitheroe, Lancashire and threatening Mrs Brown, 54. He escaped with £650, but was quickly arrested and has now pleaded guilty to robbery and being in possession of a bladed article. Speaking after Iveson was jailed for three years at Preston Crown Court, Mrs Brown said: 'He was shouting and swearing and straight away I knew it was him. 'He was one of those people who has a certain type of walk and although he had a scarf around his face and his hood up, I recognised him a mile off. 'I think it was half personal and half to line his pockets - but he's stupid and he thought I wouldn't know it was him.' Terror: Iveson was brandishing a 12in knife when he burst into the convenience store . Threat: The robber demanded money from Mrs Brown while trying to hide his identity . The court heard that Mrs Brown had known Iveson for several years, after he had a year-long relationship with her daughter and the couple had a child together. Prosecutor Neil Basarya said: 'She was in a state of panic and attempted to open the till.The till was opened and a large amount of notes were taken by Iveson. 'At one point he dropped some to the floor and collected them before exiting the shop, still holding the knife up.' In a victim impact statement read out to the court, Mrs Brown described Iveson as extremely aggressive and said the robbery had made her feel vulnerable whenever a customer entered the shop wearing a hood. 'All I want is my life back how it was and then I hope I can return to a normal and happy life,' she said. Defending Iveson, Adam Lodge said he was addicted to heroin and had committed the robbery to fund his habit. Mr Lodge said: 'There is some degree of remorse and he does mention that this incident would have been petrifying for her, but mentions she was not the specific target.' Theft: He pulled out £650 in cash from the till but was arrested by police shortly afterwards . Target: The robbery took place at the Thorougoods convenience store in Clitheroe, Lancashire . Judge Jonathan Gibson told Iveson: 'You had a long kitchen knife and you used that knife to point towards the lady who was serving in the shop. 'Not surprisingly, the offence has had a very significant impact on her.' As well as three years in prison, Iveson is subject to a restraining order which bans him from contacting Mrs Brown in any way. Reliving the moment that Iveson threatened her, Mrs Brown said: 'He just came at it with me, he was holding it in the air. He came round the side of the counter and he had the knife at the side of me. 'He was trying to get the till open and he kept saying ""You'd better get that till open now"", and calling me a b****. 'I was determined not to let him know it was me, I just kept saying, ""Calm down, calm down.""' After the sentencing, the victim said that Iveson's jail term was 'not long enough', adding: 'It was terrifying for me and it has ruined my life. It's no comfort at all knowing he will be out again in no time. 'I wish I could say he will change but I know he won't. He picked the shop because he knew I would be working, he knew my shift patterns. 'He came in 15 minutes after I'd started my shift that night, and it made it worse for me knowing who it was because I didn't think he would stop at anything. 'My daughter's relationship with him was a mistake and we try not to have anything to do with him. I have my granddaughter out of it and I wouldn't change her for the world, but otherwise I wish he didn't exist. 'He used to take great pleasure in grinning and taunting us when he saw us but we tried to ignore him and not let him get to us. I'm not surprised he did something like this.'","Kyle Iveson, 24, burst into convenience store armed with a 12in knife .

10457,"A three-bedroom apartment in one of the most expensive areas to live in Britain has been put on the market for just £575,000 - but the 'bargain' property comes with a catch. The Knightsbridge flat, London, which is on sale for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes, has just three years left on the lease. The cost would work out at £191,000 per year, or £15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area. The entrance to the flats in one of the most expensive areas to live in Britain where a three-bedroom apartment has been put on the market for just £575,000 . But if any buyer decides to extend the lease, the property could be worth upwards of £6 million. The 'unmodernised' maisonette in the in exclusive Egerton Place, is described as 'bright and well proportioned' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space. It boasts three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room and utility room along with a lift, parking and a communal garden. The property is being sold by Russell Simpson for £575,000 - the same price as a three-bedroom house in Stanmore, Middlesex. It is one of two maisonettes being sold  with three years remaining on the lease. Both homes will need to be modernised, with the second, larger property - also on Egerton Place - on the market for £595,000. The next cheapest three-bedroom property in Knightsbridge costs £1.5 million, and this flat is only offered with a 28-year lease. But the property comes with a catch, not only is it in dire need of renovation, (such as in one of its bedrooms, pictured)  the home has just three years left on the lease . The cost for £575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £191,000 per year, or £15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area, plus renovation works which are needed, such as in the living room (pictured) But if any buyer decides to extend the lease, the 'bright and well proportioned' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space, could be worth upwards of £6 million . Jake Russell, from Russell Simpson, said: 'Properties like this come up once in a blue moon and I think it is an outstanding opportunity. 'To get properties like this in Egerton Place is very exciting and the phone hasn't stopped ringing, which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner. 'We have had interest from locals, developers and end users. In modernised condition, we would estimate they would sell for between £2,750 and £3,000 per sq/ft.' This gives the smaller property a £6 million prices tag, while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £7.5 million. The current freeholder is thought to be The Welcome Trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and, for a 90-year lease, it is likely to cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million. Egerton Place was built off Michael's Grove by John Grover and Son to the designs of architect Mervyn Macartney around 1893. The properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the Egerton Gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets, finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange. Estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone 'hasn't stopped ringing' about the Egerton Place apartment . But Alex Newall, from Hanover Private Office, had a warning to potential buyers: 'It looks cheap, but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease' Leases of all the homes were granted by the Smith's Charity trustees in 1894, and its first occupant was, Sir Evan MacGregor, permanent secretary to the Admiralty. Other residents of high status included the Dowager Lady Lawrence, probably the widow of the first Baron Lawrence, at No. 5, and Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, Q.C., son of the novelist Charles at No. 2. One property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases. Alex Newall, from Hanover Private Office, said: 'It looks cheap, but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease. 'A developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder. 'It is a very quirky situation. Properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like Knightsbridge.

8882,"The artist behind a statue of Lucille Ball so terrifying it has been nicknamed 'Scary Lucy' has admitted to being 'disappointed' in his work, offering to fix the sculpture for free. Residents of Celoron, New York, hometown of the famous comedienne, reacted with shock and horror when the 'I Love Lucy' statue was unveiled in 2009. Following a recent social media campaign to have the bronze statue removed, sculptor Dave Poulin  called it 'by far my most unsettling sculpture', and pledged to make a new one. Following a campaign to have the statue of Lucille Ball sculptor Dave Poulin has pledged to make a new one . The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue' has attracted more than 600 likes. Yahoo reports that the anonymous man behind the page says he's a 'big fan of Lucy's.' 'Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty. Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful,” he told the site. 'This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go.' However, in a letter to the Hollywood Reporter, Poulin admits: From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy’s beauty or my ability as a sculptor. 'In retrospect, it should have never been cast in bronze and made public, and I take complete ownership of that poor decision.' For residents of Celoron, N.Y., say a statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is 'monstrous' The statue is based on a famous moment from Ball's show 'I Love Lucy,' in which she pitches an intoxicating health tonic while drunk . He adds that he offers to return to Celoron and 'remove the current statue with the promise of creating a new beautiful and charming ""Lucy"" in its place.' It would cost an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 for Poulin to recast the statue, according to the Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost. While the organizer said he is a fan of Poulin's work, this time he failed to do his subject justice. 'I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion,' he told Yahoo. 'When you see it at night, it is frightening.' The statue depicts Ball during one of her most loved moments on the pioneering show 'I Love Lucy,' her intoxicated pitch for the Vitameatavegamin health tonic. The statue was the latest way the town has tried to honor its most famous resident, with the Jameston area already home to a Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum & Center for Comedy.","The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy!

3656,"Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson gives his predictions ahead of the 79th Masters at Augusta on Thursday. Best American . So many to choose from but given Augusta’s predilection for a tale of redemption — from Vijay ‘kiss my ass’ Singh to Adam ‘this one’s for you, Greg’ Scott — let’s go for the reformed party animal Dustin Johnson. Time for him to prove he can match his gargantuan yardage off the tee with the requisite amount of brain cells. Dustin Johnson watches his tee shot during a practice round on the Augusta course on Wednesday . Best European (Non-UK) Not so many to choose from, alas. Indeed, given Henrik Stenson spent a week in bed with flu recently and reckons his strength is still low, we’re almost empty-handed. Still, let’s hope the Swede can rise from his sick bed. Other than that, it’s time Victor Dubuisson returned to the limelight. Henrik Stenson has only recently recovered from flu but the Swede will be hoping to mount a serious challenge . Best from the UK . Let’s leave out the history man on the grounds he has his own category. Lee Westwood has got an impressive recent record at Augusta and Justin Rose has shown he can play well here. But I have a feeling Paul Casey is the most likely to join Rory and get into contention come Sunday afternoon. Best International . You can hardly have faith in Adam Scott to emulate Bubba Watson and win a second Masters in three years given he’s confused enough on the greens to be going back to the long putter. While Scott sorts himself out, compatriot Jason Day has an outstanding chance to grab another win for Australia. Jason Day has a great chance to become another Australian winner at the Masters . Best each way bet . When you think last year’s joint runner-up Jonas Blixt is 150-1, there are some tasty odds out there. How about Padraig Harrington at 80-1? Or Bernhard Langer to finish in the top six at 400-1? My particular favourite is three-time Masters champ Phil Mickelson at 25-1. A steal. Phil Mickelson watches his fairway shot on the 11th green during his practice round on Wednesday . How will Rory do? Given what it would do for the sport and what an achievement it would represent, I fervently hope Bubba Watson is slipping a size 38 regular jacket on to McIlroy’s shoulders come Sunday night. But this might prove the major where he falls just short — and we have to wait a couple of years to enjoy his Slam. Prediction: Third . Rory McIlroy will begin his quest for a Grand Slam when the Masters kicks into action on Thursday . How will Tiger do? Not as good as some American writers believe, who are fitting him up for his fifth green jacket already on the strength of shooting 33 for the front nine on a practice round on Monday. Not as bad as the doomsayers think either, though. He should make the halfway cut… and maybe scrape into the top 20. Prediction: 19th .

He passed away at his New Bedford, Massachusetts home on April 6 at the age of 64. His family has not revealed the cause of his death. Powers' on-screen wife Bern Nadette Stanis wrote an emotion message on Facebook on Thursday to mark the actor's death. Actor Ben Powers (left) died April 6 at the age of 64. He is best known for his part on the CBS sitcom Good Times, playing the husband of main character Thelma (right, played by Bern Nadette Stanis) 'My condolences goes out to the family of Ben Powers who past a few days ago. He was a great actor and great friend who is gone too soon. He will be missed by many. Until next lifetime my friend,' Stanis wrote.

1335,"Sally Lutkin, 49, had to undergo emergency surgery and was in hospital for a week after a botched tattoo . When Sally Lutkin decided to have her grandchildren's names tattooed on her leg, she imagined ending up with a beautiful, life-long reminder of her loved ones. Instead, she was left with a gruesome black hole and a lasting scar in the middle of her calf, after being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. Mrs Lutkin, 49, had a rose surrounded by the names grandchildren Harvey, seven, Harvey Junior, six, and Cooper, one, tattooed above her left ankle in November 2013. But the tattoo quickly became so swollen that she was in agony and couldn't walk, forcing her to rush to A&E. Doctors carried out emergency surgery to stop the infection spreading to her bone. She was left with a bloody hole resembling a gunshot in the middle of her rose design, as well as an unsightly scar she will have to live with for years. Mrs Lutkin, of Kingston upon Hull, East Yorkshire, said: 'It really upset me because it's something that I wanted just for me - and it really didn't turn out that way. 'I was in the hospital for a week and it was so difficult because it's the longest I've ever been away from my babies. 'They had to operate before the infection spread down to the bone and I don't know what would have happened if they had not caught it earlier. 'The pain was horrendous - it was indescribable. I was in agony and the swelling was so bad that I couldn't walk.' Her daughter Laura, 28, noticed that the tattoo was turning red the day after the needle work was complete. But Mrs Lutkin, who works as a cleaner, dismissed it as a normal part of the healing process. She was horrified when the symptoms worsened and her leg began to swell until she could no longer walk. Her  husband Peter, 57, a labourer, rushed her to hospital and she remained there for a week while she battled the nightmare infection. Mrs Lutkin, who has five children, admitted that even 18 months later she is still feeling the effects of the infection. Mrs Lutkin wanted a tattoo of a rose and her grandchildren's names (Harvey, seven, is pictured, left). But it became infected and after an emergency operation she was left with a gruesome hole in her leg (right) She has been left with a scar even 18 months after the ordeal, and has vowed never to have another tattoo again in her life . She said: 'I still get aches and pains from it but I just have to get on with my life. 'We're a really close family and they were shocked. 'It was a hard thing for them to see me in so much pain, especially for my eldest grandkids. 'It ruined Christmas because I couldn't go out Christmas shopping and all the little ones wanted to put the decorations up - in the end, my kids had to put them up for me.' The ordeal forced her to abandon plans to add the names of one-year-olds Lottie and Harper - who were born within six days of one another - to the body art. And, with another grandchild on the way, Mrs Lutkin insists she is not tempted to tamper with ink any more. She said: 'It's put me off for life. I'd had tattoos before but I'll never have one again. 'I won't even risk getting the tattoo removed. 'No one is laying their hands on me ever again after this.'

10298,"Luke Shaw thought he had done OK as he walked off the Old Trafford pitch at half-time during Manchester United’s FA Cup tie against Arsenal last month. Steady, nothing special, but he felt invigorated all the same. The score was 1-1 and Shaw, returning to the team for the first time since United’s defeat at Swansea City in February, had kept Arsenal flyer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain reasonably quiet. Shaw was growing into that famous red shirt, getting stronger down the left flank as this fiery sixth-round tie against Arsene Wenger’s team wore on. Luke Shaw thought he had done OK against Arsenal in the FA Cup but he was substituted at half time . Louis van Gaal substituted the £28million defender, telling Shaw that he was not fit enough to play for United . Shaw has not played since and was withdrawn from the recent England squad as he struggles at United . Shaw's stats for the season show how he has struggled to hold down a regular place at left back with United . What happened next will ultimately shape his career as a United player. Louis van Gaal substituted the £28million defender, telling Shaw that he was not fit enough to play for United, and replaced him with Phil Jones for the second half. Arsenal went on to win 2-1 and getting dragged off at half-time was another blow to Shaw’s fragile self-esteem. He has not played since, withdrawn by Van Gaal from the England squad for games against Lithuania and Italy because of question marks over his fitness. His position at United has been taken by Daley Blind, shuffled across from the centre of midfield as United went on a winning run against Tottenham, Aston Villa, Liverpool and Manchester City. Shaw is struggling to come to terms with his new life, turning to United’s psychologist to declutter his mind and reboot just nine months into his career at Old Trafford. Shaw is struggling to come to terms with his new life and has turned to United's psychologist of late . Shaw had kept  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain reasonably quiet in the FA Cup clash but Van Gaal was unimpressed . There are serious concerns, particularly because his parents have spoken to the club about a lack of structure and support for their teenage son. They have every right to do so. Cash is king in football and we sometimes forget to look beyond the £28m fee United paid Southampton (£15m up front) and a five-year contract worth an eye-watering £90,000 a week. Shaw was 19 in July, returning from England’s disastrous World Cup in Brazil, where he started the final group game against Costa Rica, to meet up with his new United team-mates. Initially he lived in the Lowry Hotel, joined by his parents as he began a period of adaptation in a new city. He has since moved into a house in the suburbs. Earlier this week he hinted at some of the difficulties he has faced, awarding himself a C minus for his first season during an interview with Match of the Day magazine. At United, Shaw has found a manager in Van Gaal who has very specific and exacting demands of his players . Van Gaal has led United up the table and they crowned the recent good form with a win over Manchester City . He was assigned a dietitian and given nutritional advice as he adjusted to life as the most expensive teenage footballer in the history of the game. At Southampton he had been ordered to eschew the glasses of cola and sticky food, told to mature into his physique as he grew into a man’s body. He needs discipline and constant, caring reminders from the coaches. Those close to him explain that Shaw needs pastoral advice, that he responds positively when he feels close to the coaches and playing staff. At the age of 16, when Chelsea made an official offer for Shaw in his breakthrough season at Saints, his head was so scrambled by the prospect of joining his boyhood team that he had to be taken out of the Southampton line-up. In the dog-eat-dog world of United, where it is a constant fight for survival after last season’s disappointing finish, he has yet to establish those strong bonds. Last season he often spent time in Mauricio Pochettino’s office after training, sitting with the former Southampton manager as they discussed different areas of their lives. Mauricio Pochettino spent a lot of time with Shaw to help make him feel at home at Southampton last season . Pochettino teased the best out of a player who went on to make his England debut at the age of 18 . The club worked out that he was travelling back to his parents’ home near Cobham, Surrey, by monitoring his Twitter account and looking at the times he posted messages on social media. With Pochettino there was a real, almost paternal warmth to their relationship as the manager teased the best out of a player who went on to make his England debut at the age of 18. To put Shaw’s extraordinary rise into perspective, Kenny Sansom, perhaps England’s classiest and finest left back, had to wait until he was 20 to make his debut for the national team. Shaw’s life has changed, moving away from the bosom of his family in Surrey for the demands and challenges at a club where the spotlight is intense. He is a sensitive young man. It had been hoped that Van Gaal would show some patience with Shaw when his appointment at United was confirmed, particularly after his Champions League success at Ajax in 1995. Marc Overmars (22), Michael Reiziger (22) and Clarence Seedorf (19) all started the 1-0 victory over Milan in the final in Vienna, with striker Patrick Kluivert (18) named on the bench. Van Gaal's Champions League success at Ajax in 1995 saw him include young players in his starting XI . At the 2014 World Cup with Holland, Van Gaal had notable success with 20-year-old Memphis Depay . More recently, at the 2014 World Cup with Holland, Van Gaal had notable success with 20-year-old Memphis Depay, who was named on the three-man shortlist for the best young player at the tournament. But what Shaw found at United was a manager who has very specific and exacting demands. Before Van Gaal conceded defeat and reverted to a back four, Shaw had been playing in the unfamiliar role of wing back. The transition has many similar characteristics to Gareth Bale’s first couple of seasons with Spurs. Both are real home boys. Shaw's position at United has been taken by Daley Blind, shuffled across from the centre of midfield . The former Southampton man is learning to deal with the attention at one of the biggest football clubs around . Shaw longs for the days when he could stay behind after training with Pochettino, where the Argentinian coach would team up with one of the other young players for a light-hearted game of head tennis. It was at Southampton, under the guidance of Pochettino and the former executive chairman Nicola Cortese, where Shaw’s career flourished. The well-being of the boy was top priority. He is a United player now, learning to deal with the attention at one of the biggest football clubs in the world. At such a young age, he needs all the help he can get.","Manchester United paid almost £30million to sign Luke Shaw last summer .

An analogue promotional watch from Apple with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a ‘buy it now’ price of $2,499.99 (£1,707.47) plus postage. For the same price as the 1997 timepiece, Apple fans could pre-order five of the cheapest Apple Watch Sport, which cost £299 in the UK and still have some change.

However, it is still cheaper than the Apple Watch Edition, which costs upwards of £8,000 ($10,000). The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was made by Quartz and released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item’. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote on their eBay page. ‘A new battery has been installed and the watch is new, never used or worn.’ It is still in its original box and the seller claims to have two to offload, with 10 days to go. The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item. This image shows the listing on the auction website . Unlike Apple’s new Watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. Three versions of Apple's watch (pictured) are available to pre-order online and almost one million orders are thought to have been taken in the US on the first day alone . 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone.

'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now.

Unlike Apple’s new smart watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. The International Business Times reported that the watch is almost 50 times more valuable – according to its seller – than it was a year ago, thanks to the launch of the new Apple Watch. It’s not known how many of the vintage watches Apple had made at the time, or how many still exist, but one sold on eBay in Match last year for $54 (£37). At the time of writing, two more of the watch model are listed online for $1,000 (£679) and $750 (£510), but neither have fetched that amount of money, suggesting sellers may just be trying their luck. It's thought that Apple sold almost one million Apple Watches in the US alone on the first day that the device could be pre-ordered. It goes on sale in shops in nine countries on April 24. Apple has not confirmed any sales figures, but Tim Cook, interviewed on cable television channel CNBC, said initial orders were 'great.' Slice Intelligence measured digital commerce by tracking consumer receipts to come up with its number of 957,000 American shoppers ordering Apple Watches on the first day that they could do so. Those ordering an Apple Watch Sport, the cheapest version, spent $382.83 per watch and those ordering the Apple Watch spent $707.04. 'As expected, most consumers – 62 percent – purchased the less-expensive Sport model,' said Jaimee Minney of Slice. The data also showed that most consumers opted for the larger 42 mm case. Apple predicted on Thursday that demand would exceed supply at product launch. Soon after online pre-orders opened on Friday, Apple's website listed shipping times in June for some models of the watch and four to six weeks for others. There was immediately brisk bidding on eBay for confirmed orders for watches, with hundreds of sellers looking to make a few hundred or even thousand dollars by passing on their watches, once received. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote.

Around 650 foreign entrants, three times more than last year, joined in today's event under the constant watch of soldiers. The event - which only opened its doors to non-local amateurs in 2014 - was founded in 1981 in the single-party country, which is now led by brutal dictator Kim Jong un. One of this year's entrants Duncan Erasmus (far left) a 23 year-old software firm owner from Auckland ran in the full amateur marathon . Charles Kobold, a cable TV installation guy from the state of Wyoming, took gold in the 10km race. There were also categories for amateur full and half marathon runners plus North Korean entrants. Foreign professionals were not allowed to take part. Last year Will Marks, the British man who won the amateur half marathon category, revealed how runners were banned from displaying country flags and western logos. Photography was also forbidden, but many runners flouted the rule. Photographs of this year's event were submitted by people from Koryo Tours who flouted the ban to secretly snap the runners on their smartphones. One of this year's entrants Duncan Erasmus, a 23 year-old software firm owner from Auckland who ran the full amateur marathon, told MailOnline he was aware of being constantly watched but said the atmosphere remained jovial. Charles Kobold, a cable TV installation guy from the state of Wyoming, took gold in the 10km race . The event starts and finishes at the Rungnado May Day Stadium or Kim Il Sung Stadium (pictured) every year . Local entrants to the Pyongyang marathon were joined this year by hundreds of runners from across the world . Runners praised the jovial atmosphere as thousands of supporters turned out to cheer them on . ‘I did feel like I was in a bit of a bubble,’ he said. ‘The North Koreans were very friendly during the run but outside of it there was a marked change. They were very cautious about interacting with us, whereas it felt like during the marathon they were allowed [to interact more freely]. ‘Our cameras were confiscated by our tour guides – although they asked us for them very politely. ‘Although, like last year, some people managed to get through with cameras anyway.’ He added that alongside the thousands of supporters who came out to cheer them on was a huge number of soldiers strategically positioned to ensure that no-one stepped out of line or saw anything they weren't supposed to. ‘The soldiers were stern and restrained in their actions but even they cracked the occasional smile,’ said Mr Erasmus. ‘Their presence was everywhere – you could always see the uniform. ‘When I was running I noticed that they were positioned in places that could be deemed sensitive. For example, I saw three soldiers standing by an entrance to a construction site. They don’t like you photographing or even seeing construction.’ This year saw around 650 foreign entrants, three times more than last year, join in the Pyongyang marathon . Entrants were ran past North Korean monuments on during the marathon, such as the Arch of Triumph . Photographs of this year's event were submitted by people from Koryo Tours who flouted the ban to secretly snap the runners on their smartphones . Around 5,000 westerners visit North Korea every year. All tourists face tight restrictions and must be accompanied by guides who work for state-owned companies. Free roaming is banned. In February authorities announced that the marathon would be closed to foreigners due to North Korea’s borders being closed to keep out Ebola, despite no cases of the disease being reported in the country. They reversed their decision shortly afterwards. Mr Kobold, a 30 year-old cable TV installation worker from the city of Casper, won the 10km amateur race in the isolated country with a time of 40 minutes and 20 seconds. Speaking to MailOnline after the winners’ ceremony that took place in front of thousands of North Koreans in Pyongyang’s Kim il Sung Stadium, he described how he came second in last year’s 10km run. Back then he fainted due to exhaustion before picking up his medal, but he had no such problems this time round. 2014 Winner: British runner Will Marks  triumphed in the North Korean half marathon after the event was opened to foreigners for the first time last year . Photography was also forbidden at the marathon and other races but many runners flouted the rule . One of this year's entrants told MailOnline he was aware of being constantly watched but said the atmosphere remained jovial . ‘I only did the 10km run but I felt like a million dollars – I had 50,000 locals cheering me on in the stadium,’ he said. He added, ‘A lovely Korean woman in traditional dress gave me a porcelain vase, which was instead of the medals they gave out last year. It’s pretty big, it’ll have to be my carry-on luggage when I go back to the US.’ The race, named the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon after the late North Korea leader Kim il Sung’s birthplace, gave foreigners the rare chance to run through the streets of Pyongyang, which is home to the country’s elite classes. Thousands of locals came out in force to cheer them on. ‘There was a festival atmosphere – there were so many people waving and shouting “Hurry up!” in Korean to me,’ said Mr Kobold. He added, ‘I was high-fiving so many people. By the end my arms were in such pain from doing it, I couldn’t even wave to any more supporters.’ The marathon trip, like all other heavily-vetted tourist trips to North Korea, gave foreigners a sanitised view of the country .

Founded in 1981 in the single-party country, which is now led by brutal dictator Kim Jong un . It offered no glimpse of the horrors that allegedly exist outside the version of North Korea authorities allow outsiders to see. Human rights groups claim that torture, infanticide and oppression characterise Kim’s dictatorship and are kept from view. But Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, the tour firm that Mr Kobold travelled with, told MailOnline that events such as the marathon were good for increasing interaction with the culturally-isolated country. ‘It’s a good thing because anything that has foreigners interacting, even in the simplest way such as high-fiving, is positive,’ he said. He added, ‘At this marathon any interactions were fleeting. But it was a spectacle and an opportunity for the locals to see hundreds of foreigners and for foreigners to see thousands of North Koreans.’ During his 10km race Mr Kobold ran past landmarks such as the imposing Arch of Triumph and statues of late North Korean leaders Kim il Sung and Kim Jong il. He is staying in the Yanggakdo International Hotel before returning home. Despite Kim’s hatred of the US, and the fact that anti-US rallies regularly take place in Pyongyang, Mr Kobold found that western comforts were available in the hotel. ‘You can easily buy Coca Cola there,’ he said. ‘And I was pleasantly surprised to find Milka chocolate, which is originally from Germany, available.’ However, he said he was more likely to indulge in a few glasses of the local beer, Taedonggang, to celebrate his victory. ‘I’ve been enjoying it – it’s a little spicy but it’d stand up to a pint of Worthington’s,’ he said. Runners, in matching red tracksuits, lined up for the race which was closed to foreigners due to North Korea’s borders being closed to keep out Ebola, despite no cases of the disease being reported in the country.

11302,"Richie Benaud’s family have been offered a state funeral after Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called his death the ‘greatest loss for cricket since the loss of Don Bradman’. The former Australia captain and legendary broadcaster died on Wednesday at the age of 84 following a battle with skin cancer. Abbott said: ‘There would be very few Australians who have not passed a summer in the company of Richie Benaud. Richie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Benaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBC . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has offered Benaud's family a state funeral . Benaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his time as Australia captain . Benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . ‘He was the accompaniment of an Australian summer, his voice was even more present than the chirping of the cicadas in our suburbs and towns, and that voice, tragically, is now still. But we remember him with tremendous affection.’ State funerals in Australia are generally reserved for politicians. Even Bradman himself turned down the offer of one before his death in 2001. But such is the esteem in which Benaud was held, both as an engaging all-round cricketer – he took 248 Test wickets with his leg-breaks and scored 2,201 runs – and as a commentator, that Abbott has been moved to make an exception. David Gower, Geoffrey Boycott and Benaud assembled a formidable line-up for the BBC in 1995 . A master with the microphone to his lips, Benaud also was well aware of the power of silence . The tributes continued on Friday to a man routinely referred to as ‘the voice of cricket’. His fellow leg-spinner Shane Warne said, ‘For me it was an honour and a privilege to call you a close friend and mentor’, while Sachin Tendulkar described his death as a ‘great loss to the world of cricket’. Australia’s Test captain Michael Clarke praised Benaud for helping ‘the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way’. One of Clarke’s predecessors, Steve Waugh, said: ‘His legacy to the game will always live on.’ The veteran Australian radio commentator Jim Maxwell said: ‘He has been the most influential, revered and respected person in the game for 50 years. As Australian captain he never lost a series. As a commentator he was precise, authoritative and deliciously understated.’ Benaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and loved . Benaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005 . ON COMMENTATING . 'What I want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that, when I say something, I am talking to friends.' 'My mantra is: put your brain into gear and if you can add to what's on the screen then do it, otherwise shut up.' 'The key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see.' 'Out in the field, you haven't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things, you've got to do it yourself.' ON CAPTAINCY . 'The hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss, at the right time.' 'Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don't try it without that 10 per cent.' ON BATTING . 'Bruce Reid is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the Myer Music Bowl to hold a convention.' 'Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century.' 'He's not quite got hold of that one. If he had, it would have gone for nine.' ON BOWLING . 'A bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner.' 'Your wrist must be cocked, but not stiffly cocked.' 'You must always look where you want to land it. If I offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can, you'd never take your eyes off it.' ON TWENTY20 CRICKET . 'If any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it's great for the sport. I think it's wonderful.' 'As long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game I think it will be terrific.' ON SHANE WARNE'S 'BALL OF THE CENTURY . 'Gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it. Still doesn't know.' ON 1981's 'UNDERARM BOWLING' SCANDAL . 'A disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong. It should never be permitted to happen again. One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field.' MISCELLANEOUS . 'The slow-motion replay doesn't show how fast the ball was really travelling.' 'A cricket ground is a flat piece of earth with some buildings around it.' 'He's usually a good puller - but he couldn't get it up that time.' 'Cricket has changed for the better ... it's because of what happened then, cricket is so strong now.'","Richie Benaud passed away aged 84 on Friday .

658,"Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has labelled Nigel Farage a 'd***' during last night's leader's debate. The former England footballer launched the scathing attack on the head of Ukip after leaders from each of the seven largest parties went head-to-head for the first time in the historic TV election debate. Opinion polls produced mixed results on who had 'won' the contest, with ComRes survey showing that 40 per cent of voters think David Cameron is 'most capable of leading the country', while others backed SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and others putting Ed Miliband ahead. Scroll down for videos . Leader of Ukip Nigel Farage has come under attack for his controversial comments made on the TV election debate last night . Match of the Day pundit Gary Lineker labelled Mr Farage a 'd***' after claimed that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment . Mr Farage topped the list for worst and best performing leaders after his controversial comments that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment. The debate spurred a flurry of reaction from footballing stars on Twitter who came out to give their opinions on the leaders. Mr Lineker tweeted: 'Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!' He took another dig at the Ukip leader later on writing: 'Who would you back? I reckon Farage would leather it over the bar. And blame the foreign goalkeeper for moving.' Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was also left uninspired by the debate, tweeting: 'Unfortunately, none of these people on that stage engage with the generation of today.' The former England player took another dig at the Ukip leader later on writing: 'Who would you back? I reckon Farage would leather it over the bar. And blame the foreign goalkeeper for moving' Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was also left uninspired by the debate tweeting that the leaders had failed to engage with today's generation . The Match of the Day presenter launched the scathing attack on the head of Ukip after leaders from each of the seven largest parties went head-to-head for the first time in the historic TV election debate . Mr Miliband, whose hopes of using the debate to catapult him into Number 10 floundered last night, also came under fire. The Labour leader fell flat during the clash, and was left lost for words after being challenged on live TV by Nick Clegg to apologise for Labour crashing the economy. Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Sol Campbell criticised the Labour leader on Twitter saying: 'I've captained a number of teams and it's clear to see Miliband is no leader.' While Mr Lineker suggested a different way to settle the debate. 'Can this please end with a penalty shoot-out. #leadersdabate.' It was the first time ever that leaders of the seven largest parties had gone head-to-head in a televised election debate . Both Mr Farage and Labour leader Ed Miliband faced criticism for their performances at the ITV debate . A BBC Spokesperson said: 'Gary has no involvement in any BBC programmes involving news, current affairs or politics. In common with other such presenters, therefore, he is able to express views on personal social media and that has no bearing on the BBC's impartiality.' In the first debate of its kind, lots were drawn in advance to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The seven party leaders clashed repeatedly on spending and the future of the NHS, as Mr Cameron bluntly told Mr Miliband: 'It's a service not a weapon.' Mr Farage launched into a controversial rant on 'health tourism', complaining about people with HIV who come to Britain in search of treatment. But Miss Wood, leader of Welsh Nationalists Plaid Cymru, won the first significant applause of the night as she accused Mr Farage of 'dangerous scaremongering' for blaming migrants for problems in the NHS. She told him he should be 'ashamed' of himself. Mr Farage caused outrage after he said that people with HIV should not be welcomed into Britain for treatment. Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Sol Campbell got stuck in to Labour leader Ed Miliband saying he was 'no leader' Mr Lineker suggested a more football-friendly way to end the debate- with a penalty shoot-out . He said: 'Here's a fact and I'm sure that other people will be mortified that I dare to talk about it. 'There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive. 'It's not a good place for any of them to be I know, but 60 per cent of them are not British nationals. 'They're both blaming each other and they're both right' - Ed Miliband on David Cameron and Nick Clegg. 'When he was in the Cabinet about half a million people lost their jobs so never mind zero-hours, with Ed there'd be zero jobs' - David Cameron on Ed Miliband. 'Nigel Farage talks about 'remember history'. The Farage family were foreigners once. I'm married to a foreigner. You are married to a foreigner' - Nick Clegg to Nigel Farage. 'What's going on here? Get real, please' - Nigel Farage to everyone else. 'The answer is investing more in homes and public services and enforcing a decent minimum wage, not scapegoating immigrants' - Nicola Sturgeon . 'You don't have to go on voting for the lesser of two evils. That's how we ended up with the tired, failed politics that we have now' - Natalie Bennett. 'It was not Polish care workers or Estonian bar workers who caused this economic crisis - it was bankers' - Leanne Wood. 'You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 a year per patient. 'I know there are some horrible things happening in many part of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.' At the end of the historic contest, Mr Miliband said: 'You've heard from seven leaders tonight. But there's one fundamental choice. 'If I'm Prime Minister I will make sure everyone will play by the same rules. If I'm Prime Minister we will cut the deficit every year. 'I believe that when working people succeed Britain succeeds. If you believe in that too, then I ask for your vote.' Mr Cameron had the last word, after drawing the final slot, telling viewers: 'I've been your Prime Minister for the last five years and all that time I've tried to have one task in mind above all others. 'And that has been turning our economy around, putting the country back to work and clearing up the mess that was left to us. 'I want to stand for another five years because I want us to finish the job that we have all started. We've created two million jobs. Let's create a job for everyone that wants and needs one.' The Prime Minister had been accused ahead of the clash of 'running scared' after dodging a head-to-head showdown with the Labour leader. After Mr Cameron objected to broadcasters' plans for three TV debates during the five-and-a-half week campaign, the ITV show marked the only occasion before the May 7 election where the Tory and Labour leaders faced each other.","Gary Lineker launched the scathing attack after  historic election debate .

3382,"When Floyd Mayweather posted a picture of a signed contract for his $300 million mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao two months ago, there was a collective sigh of relief. After more than five years of wrangling and bickering, the richest fight in boxing history was finally set for May 2 in Las Vegas. But with 11 days to go until the two protagonists are due to touch gloves, not a single person has a ticket in their hands. Floyd Mayweather fights Manny Pacquiao next weekend but officially, no tickets are on sale . That's not to say that nobody has bought one; SeatGeek, which claims to be the world's largest event ticket search engine, is selling briefs for up to $30,000 (£20,000). These are known as 'spec tickets' which the sellers don't have but expect to get before the fight. The venue for the bout, the 16,500-capacity MGM Grand Arena has the following message on its website: . 'Details on ticket sales coming soon! Please be aware that tickets for the May 2, 2015, Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight are not yet available for purchase. 'Buyers should use extra caution when purchasing alleged tickets from unofficial sources, for fraudulent or counterfeit tickets will not be accepted.' So why the delay? Initially, Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum said tickets would be on sale in the first week of April but that less than 1,000 - priced between $1,500 and $7,500 - were expected to be made available to the public. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum (left) has blamed Mayweather's side for the lack of tickets . Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, claimed they would be on sale last week . The rest would be distributed by the fighters, promoters, television networks Showtime and HBO and the MGM Grand. But last week, SeatGeek analyst Connor Gregoire said: 'It's bizarre, normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight. To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.' Gregoire went on to say that only a dozen tickets had been sold through the website at an average price of $8,000 (£5,400). Another ticketing site, StubHub, are yet to put any tickets on sale. Spokesperson Alison Salcedo said: 'There's still so much up in the air for this fight that we're not allowing spec sales. We're not willing to take that risk now.' As far as Arum is concerned, the blame lies squarely on Mayweather's side. 'All of this is on the MGM (Grand), I mean, if you think that the MGM is calling the shots here, you're totally mistaken. It's the man behind the curtain,' he told Boxing Scene, alluding to Mayweather's adviser Al Haymon. Mayweather trains with his uncle Roger during a media workout in Las Vegas last week . Pacquiao is taken on the pads by trainer Freddie Roach in front of the watching media . 'This is going to the governor's office. This is an absolute disgrace, what's happening. 'What do you want from me? It's not on us.' Pacquiao's manager Michael Koncz has also expressed his frustration. He said: 'It's a real mess right now. I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the holdup? I'm more than a little upset they're not for sale to the public.' In the opposite corner, Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe has claimed Arum was lashing out because he is not the lead promoter in the fight. 'Every time he doesn't get his way, he goes running to the press misrepresenting the facts,' he said. 'The bottom line is this: Bob cannot stomach the fact that he is not the lead promoter. Reality has set in, and this is typical Bob. My responsibility is to ensure every deal is done properly, to benefit the fighters and the event.' It remains to be seen who will make up the 16,500-capacity crowd at the MGM Grand . Ellerbe did say that tickets would be on sale last week but there is no sign of an end to the stalemate. Nor is there any indication of when the reported 50,000 closed-circuit seats at MGM properties - priced at around $150 (£100) - in Las Vegas will be available to purchase. The hotel's website says simply: 'Please check back for closed-circuit viewing availability at other MGM Resorts Properties.' In fact, the only ticket you can buy is for the weigh-in. Priced at $10, the unusual step has been taken in an effort to control the expected huge crowd but all proceeds will go to charity with each fighter nominating their choice. With UFC star Ronda Rousey guaranteed the only free ticket from Arum and Amir Khan set to be ringside next Saturday as he eyes a future fight against either man, there will at least be a crowd of sorts. But who will join them is anyone's guess.","Floyd Mayweather takes on Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2 .

The controversial batsman has been named in Surrey's 13-man squad for the three-day warm-up against an Oxford University side at The Parks, which gets under way on Sunday. A short statement on Surrey's official website said: 'Kevin Pietersen is named in the squad as Surrey head to The Parks for their final pre-season game before their opening first-class fixture against Glamorgan next week.' Kevin Pietersen has been named in Surrey's 13-man squad to play Oxford University . Pietersen lines up with his Surrey team-mates ahead of his long awaited return to domestic cricket . The former England batsman unsurprisingly got the lion's share of attention from photograhpers . The 34-year-old has played almost exclusively Twenty20 cricket in various leagues around the world since being axed by England following the humiliating Ashes whitewash defeat last year. Indeed, he has not played a first-class match since January 2014, when Australia sealed a 5-0 thrashing of England in Sydney, while his last appearance for Surrey in the LV= County Championship was in June 2013. But he has given up a lucrative deal with Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad in order to come back to Surrey as he bids to win back his England spot. Pietersen hopes he can add to his 104 Test caps and much-storied international career with successful performances for Surrey, who have been only too happy to welcome back the South African-born batsman. The 34-year-old has not played first-class cricket since being axed by England after last year's Ashes . Piestersen jokes around by taking a picture of photographers from his phone . Meanwhile, Pietersen has thrown his support behind former team-mate Michael Vaughan as the right man to 'change the brand of cricket currently being played' in England. Ten years on from his career-defining captaincy in the 2005 Ashes, Vaughan is the hot favourite to be appointed as director of England cricket, a streamlined version of the managing director's job which was abolished with Paul Downton's sacking on Wednesday. 'He (Vaughan) is close enough to the game to make changes which need to happen for the good of English cricket,' Pietersen said. 'The way he captained shows he'll change the brand of cricket currently being played, which we need.'

6387,"The Florida mailman who caused a major security scare when he landed his gyro-copter on the US Capitol lawn on Wednesday afternoon was just seconds from being shot out of the sky. House Homeland Security panel Chairman Michael McCaul revealed that Capitol authorities had Doug Hughes, 61, in their sights and were prepared to open fire. 'Had it gotten any closer to the speaker's balcony they have long guns to take it down, but it didn't. It landed right in front,' McCaul said about the flight which was undetected until authorities actually saw the craft approach. However, Hughes claims he informed the Secret Service and Capitol police of his potentially lethal stunt into the no-fly zone, which was designed to draw attention to campaign finance reform and government corruption. Speaking prior to the flight and just days after a man shot himself dead in front of the Capitol on Saturday causing panic, Hughes appeared confident he would survive his 'insane' protest. 'I don't believe that the authorities are going to shoot down a 61-year-old mailman in a flying bicycle,' said Hughes of the latest embarrassment for White House and Capitol security. Indeed, NORAD reported that they did not scramble any assets and were not informed of the flight until it had landed. And local Washington D.C. response helicopter units designed to deal with slow moving targets admitted they did not react either. Scroll Down for Video .

Campaign for change: In these April, 2015, photos, Doug Hughes puts address labels on half of the 535 letters to Congress that he intended to deliver via gyro-copter at his home in Ruskin . Doug Hughes' close friend Mike Shanahan, said today that the Hughes is not a terrorist and did not mean any harm with his protest. 'I was scared to death they were going to kill him,' Shanahan said to the Tampa Bay Times. 'My thanks goes out to whomever it was who decided not to pull the trigger.' The mailman's flight to raise awareness for campaign finance reform and donation caps caused the Capitol to go into lockdown as stunned members of the public watched him land his single-seat gyro-copter around 2pm and breach the No-Fly 'P56-Zone'. 'He has no weapons or anything else,' said Michael Shanahan to CNN. 'I know him personally. He's like a pitbull when he has an idea. He wants to wake up the country.' Hughes, who has been planning his 'insane' D.C. flight for two years was promptly arrested by police and FBI teams moved in quickly afterwards with bomb disposal robots. Capitol Police didn't immediately identify the pilot or comment on his motive, but a Florida postal carrier named Doug Hughes took responsibility for the stunt on a website where he said he was delivering letters to all 535 members of Congress in order to draw attention to campaign finance corruption. 'As I have informed the authorities, I have no violent inclinations or intent,' Hughes wrote on his website, thedemocracyclub.org. 'An ultralight aircraft poses no major physical threat - it may present a political threat to graft. I hope so. There's no need to worry - I'm just delivering the mail.'

Resting: The gyro-copter sits on the West Front lawn with emergency vehicles surrounding it after it came down on Wednesday afternoon . Furious interest: Members of the media converge near Constitution Avenue on Capitol Hill in Washington . Evidence: The illegally landed craft  was piloted by Florida mailman Doug Hughes to protest against government corruption and to promote campaign finance reform . Embarrassment: A gyro copter that was flown onto the grounds of the U.S. Capitol is seen on the west front lawn in Washington . Witnesses said the craft approached the Capitol from the west, flying low over the National Mall and the Capitol reflecting pool across the street from the building. It barely cleared a row of trees and a statue of Gen. Ulysses Grant. John Jewell, 72, a tourist from Statesville, North Carolina, said the craft landed hard and bounced. An officer was already there with a gun drawn. 'He didn't get out until police officers told him to get out. He had his hands up'' and was quickly led away by the police, Jewell said. 'They snatched him pretty fast.' Elizabeth Bevins, a tourist from Atlanta, said she was standing across the street from the Capitol when the helicopter flew in around 20 or 30 feet high, and it 'just sort of plopped down on the lawn.' Downtown Washington is blanketed by restrictions on air traffic that generally prohibit aircraft from flying over the White House, the Capitol, the national Mall and key buildings without special permission. The Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot hadn't notified it of his plans to enter restricted airspace. The situation was under investigation and streets in the area were shut down. Emergency vehicles were dispatched to the area and a robot bomb detector was sent over to the craft. Amid the commotion, the small craft presented a strange sight sitting on the green lawn of the Capitol, its rotors slowly spinning. Landed: The gyro-copter sits on the West Lawn after it came to a halt having defied the no-fly zone over the US Capitol and White House . According to the Tampa Bay Times, 61-year-old Doug Hughes has been planning the stunt for two years saying, 'No sane person would do what I'm doing.' In a report published by the newspaper prior to this afternoon's unauthorized landing, Hughes said, 'I have got a plane, a gyro-plane. And I'm going to fly it, I'm going to violate the no-fly zone, non-violently,' he says in the video posted to the newspapers website. 'I'm going to land on the Capitol Mall.' Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times prior to his flight, Hughes said that he had phoned the Secret Service to tell them he would land in front of the Capitol and that he had emailed Barack Obama's public email too. He said that he flight would serve as a protest against rampant lobby and interest groups controlling the political process and a wake-up call for security. 'Again, I'm going to fly low and slow and these guys are going to have a full head of adrenaline. Eventually, I'm hoping the Blackhawk will catch up with me about the time that the authorities realize that I'm not a threat and knocking me down is not a politically savvy move, and I anticipate having an escort all the way in. I'm hoping for a friendly escort.' Recovery: Various officials take a close up look at the scene where a small gyro-copter landed on the US Capitol lawn . Authorities load the gyro-copter onto the back of a truck to remove it from the West Front of the US Capitol . Retrieval: People walk past the gyro-copter that was flown onto the grounds of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday . While he got no escort and the authorities were not aware of his incoming flight, Hughes is aware of what the consequences will now be. He anticipates losing his job with the US Postal Service and expects to lose his freedom. He admits to not telling his Russian-born wife or his four living children for fear they would be implicated. At the bottom line of his protest is his belief that money has corrupted democracy. 'We're heading full-throttle toward a breakdown,' he said to the Tampa Bay Times. 'There's no question that we need government, but we don't have to accept that it's a corrupt government that sells out to the highest bidder. We can have a government that works for the people, that answers to the people, that can only take money from the people in small amounts.' Hughes became politically radicalized two-and-a-half years ago when his 24-year-old son from a previous marriage committed suicide by driving his car head-on into another car - killing the driver. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times, Hughes says that 'something changed in me' and that he realized he had to commit to making a change in this world. He hit upon his daring gyro-copter plan and set up a website and began to email every TV station and newspaper he could. He also told the Secret Service. Indeed, Hughes claims an agent came to see him last spring to ask him about his stunt and left him his card. Before he set off today, Hughes told the Times, 'I have thought about walking away from this whole thing because it's crazy,' he said. 'But I have also thought about being 80 years old and watching the collapse of this country and thinking that I had an idea once that might have arrested the fall and I didn't do it. 'And I will tell you completely honestly: I'd rather die in the flight than live to be 80 years old and see this country fall.'","Florida mailman breaches no-fly zone and lands gyro-copter on US Capitol West Front Lawn .

The London-based lawyer's wardrobe has gone from strength-to-strength since she tied the knot with George Clooney in Venice, Italy, last September. From elegant cream jumpsuits to panel shift dresses and suit/skirt combos, the 37-year-old always seems to get the balance of smart and sexy just right. But her effortless look is not without the help of a few designer items. From Prada and Stella McCartney to Dolce & Gabbana and Alexander McQueen, the stylish lawyer seems to spare no expense when it comes to dressing herself. Several of the outfits she has been photographed in since her lavish wedding to the world-famous actor cost at least £1,000, with the star spending a whopping £66,900 alone on the clothes she is pictured wearing in this feature. Sept 30, 2014: Her marriage in Venice to the world’s most eligible bachelor, movie star George Clooney, gave us our first glimpse of Amal’s impeccable taste.

3248,"Dutch football made a killing in the stock market this week. Yet its rise was not because PSV Eindhoven won their first Eredivisie title since 2008, ending Ajax's four-year reign. It was down to Memphis Depay, who scored his 20th goal of the season to confirm their 22nd championship in Holland. It turned heads at Manchester United. Yet Jim Lawlor, their chief scout, had been doing his homework long before Depay reached the total which Louis van Gaal holds in such high regard. PSV Eindhoven's Memphis Depay celebrates with the trophy after securing the Eredivisie championship . Depay (left) and PSV team-mate Georginio Wijnaldum (right) celebrate with the Eredivisie trophy . PSV manager Phillip Cocu (left) and top goalscorer Depay (right) clinched the title with three games to spare . 20 – Memphis Depay (winger) 19 – Luuk de Jong (striker) 16 – Michiel Kramer (striker) 14 – Michael de Leeuw (striker) 14 – Mark Uth (striker) The manager announced in February he lacked a striker who could score 20 goals. If a 21-year-old can do it from the wing in 27 appearances, albeit in Holland rather than England, is that not worth a £25million investment? Manchester United think so, and they are not alone. From 'official talks' with Liverpool, to 'discussions' with Paris Saint-Germain, to a not-so-secret meeting in Manchester. Depay has been busy, and no wonder. He is the Eredivisie's top goalscorer, without even being PSV's main forward. His 20 goals have contributed 12 points, which just so happens to be the difference between them and second-placed Ajax. Yet not many people had heard of Depay, particularly before the 2014 World Cup, so why the sudden case of rubbing hands together? How Depay could look for Manchester United should he make his £25m move to Old Trafford this summer . Depay pictured in action during PSV's title-winning victory against Heerenveen last weekend at home . Depay is the Eredivisie's top goalscorer with 20, without even being PSV's main forward in their attack . Depay was understood to have held a meeting in Manchester  as he nears his £25m move with Louis van Gaal . First, his background. He has 'dream chaser' tattooed across his chest, and 'successful' inked on the inside of his lower lip. Joining the iconic Manchester United brand would not contradict either, particularly given his difficult childhood. As a four-year-old, his parents separated. In 2012, after turning 18, he dropped 'Depay' from the back of his shirt as a snub to his absent father. Raised by his mother in the southern Dutch town of Moordrecht, he grew up in 'a small village where there is not much to do', so says Gigi, a childhood friend of Depay's. Yet some of the greatest footballers were created in such places. Take Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, for example. He grew up in poverty-stricken rural Chile in a mining town called Tocopilla – literal meaning Devil's Corner. With Depay poised to join the Barclays Premier League, talk is of him being paid the same as Sanchez – £130,000 a week. Yet the man handed his Holland debut just 18 months ago by Van Gaal remains relatively unknown. The manager sees something in him. As a player, Depay can be used as a makeshift forward, and has been likened to Cristiano Ronaldo by PSV manager Phillip Cocu and Ajax great Ronald de Boer. He's fast-paced, tricky, and physical. A left winger who cuts inside with a powerful right foot – not unlike his counterpart and compatriot Arjen Robben. His specialty is free-kicks. Five of his 20 goals were from dead-ball situations – his latest against Heerenveen seven days ago, when PSV were crowned champions with three games to spare. His talents aren't new to those in Holland, however. Nobody in Eredivisie completed more dribbles (101) last season, and he created the second-most chances (87), too. Depay has 'dream chaser' tattooed across his chest, and 'successful' inked on the inside of his lower lip . Depay celebrates with his Holland team-mate Arjen Robben during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Memphis, a right-footed left-winger, celebrates with his counterpart Robben, a left-footed right-winger . It is exactly what Manchester United need, given they have created fewer chances (332) than Queens Park Rangers (342) and Tottenham Hotspur (352) this season. It led to his potential being recognised by Europe's heavyweights during the summer. Called up, the then-20-year-old's goal against Australia made him the youngest Dutch scorer in the history of the World Cup, taking over from Boudewijn Zenden at France '98. That was Depay's first goal in Brazil, before his second against Chile – the same total England's squad managed as a collective in Group D. When Holland used a 4-3-3 formation, he got the nod to join Robben and Robin van Persie in a three-pronged attack. He had four shots, with 100 per cent accuracy, and scored two of them. Already a disciple of Louis van Gaal's philosophy, it seems. Compare Depay to Manchester United's other forwards – Wayne Rooney, Van Persie, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson – and he blitzes the averages of the rest. He scores a goal every 115.2 minutes (with Van Persie nearest on 119.3). He creates a chance every 41.9 minutes (with Rooney nearest on 62.5). He makes a run every 14.9 minutes (with Rooney, again, nearest on 37.1). And so on. How Depay could look for Manchester United (left) and the winger playing last week for PSV (right) Old Trafford forwards Wayne Rooney (from left to right), Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson . And yet, he is not the complete package. Not quite. He has been labelled greedy by some, averaging a shot every 19.9 minutes, having had 277 in 79 appearances in Eredivisie in the last three seasons. Even Gareth Bale, the supposed ball-hog at Real Madrid, averages fewer (24.3 minutes per shot). As is understandable with young players, his decision-making leaves a lot to be desired, too. He needs teaching, perhaps by his former national manager in Manchester. Depay wouldn't be the first to leave PSV for the Premier League, or even Old Trafford for that matter, after all. Thursday marked 14 years since Sir Alex Ferguson signed Ruud van Nistelrooy from PSV for a then-British transfer record of £19m. The striker went on to make 150 appearances, scoring 95 goals, averaging one every 128.2 minutes. A success. Depay wouldn't be the first to leave PSV for the Premier League, or Manchester United for that matter . Ruud van Nistelrooy (left) joined Manchester United from PSV, while Mateja Kezman (right) joined Chelsea . Three years after one PSV great arrived, another followed. Yet Mateja Kezman had little impact in the Premier League with Chelsea. He made just 25 appearances, scoring four goals with no assists, averaging one every 184.5 minutes. A dud. Depay could do worse than join the project at Manchester United. The Premier League can be as unforgiving as it is rewarding when it comes to potential-laden youngsters. They more often than not get found out, as £20m Brazilian Anderson was. Yet Depay can strive for great things, if his statistics are anything to go by, and putting it on the pitch at Old Trafford could be the next challenge for the 'dream chaser'. Depay could soon be joining the Premier League as he looks set to sign for Manchester United for £25m .","Memphis Depay held a secret meeting Manchester United recently .

8354,"West of Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)The call from Faleh Essawi, the deputy chief of the provincial council, who we were supposed to be meeting up with, came just as we were about to hit the bridge -- the only safe route from Baghdad to neighboring Anbar province. ""ISIS has taken the east of the city, it's not accessible,"" he says, sounding frantic, rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas ISIS fighters had just stormed into. Moments later, we see the impact: An endless stream of humanity, shell shocked, and exhausted. Parents cradle babies in blankets, some struggle under the weight of their belongings, some carry small plastic bags, while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands. Cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the Euphrates. The government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into Iraq's capital. Those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men, normally used to carry produce to markets. An elderly woman sits in one, a child in her arms, a worn down plastic doll in her hand. Many don't want to talk, at least not for long. What they just went through is too raw, too painful. One man we encounter describes how ISIS fighters commandeered his house. ""We heard clashes in the early morning, and we couldn't see the security forces anywhere,"" he recalls. ""We saw the ISIS fighters, they just came into the house, they didn't say a word. They just sent a sniper to the roof.  I grabbed my children and ran."" His wife bursts into tears, prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore -- they just want to keep going. Another older woman, sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren, starts sobbing the moment we approach her. ""They took our homes and kicked us out,"" she cries. Over the weekend ISIS moved into towns just to the north of Ramadi, which lies 68 miles (110km) west of Baghdad, sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city.  ISIS had already blocked off access from the south months ago, and the west was contested territory.  The east, until now, was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit. At a hospital in Amriyat al-Falluja, about a 15-minute drive away, a wounded local fighter winces in pain. He was shot by a sniper in Ramadi that morning as ISIS fighters advanced -- the bullet barely missed his heart. ""We had been warning we could see their movements,"" he tells us. ""But we just didn't have the force to hold them off.  We didn't leave a single person we didn't call and ask for back up."" But none came. Hours after our morning conversation we speak to Essawi again by phone. ""Security is collapsing in the city,"" he screams. ""This is what we warned Baghdad would happen. Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi? ""Just God knows if we will survive this,"" he says and hangs up. Amriyat al-Falluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from ISIS positions nearby. The hospital's façade is scarred by shrapnel. The wards are full of people injured during these attacks. Fifteen-year-old Mustafa Ahmed has bandages on his neck, leg, and other parts of his body. ""A mortar fell on our street, one of my neighbors was wounded,"" he explains. ""We went out to help him and the second one fell on us."" His friend died, he says. In the next room Amal Ahmed speaks softly. ""I was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open,"" she says, as tears roll down her face. ""Something fell out of me and I grabbed it and I put it back in and I lay down."" She starts to cry harder. Her husband was killed by U.S. forces in Fallujah -- another city in Anbar -- in 2003.  Her children have all moved away except her youngest, who broke his arm in the same attack. ""When I see the situation I don't have hope, it's just getting worse."" A few moments later, we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospital's buildings. They think it's an ISIS rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the Iraqi forces we are with in the hallway, away from the windows. More explosions go off in the distance. Then another actually shakes our building. ""Anyone want tea?"" one of the policemen with us asks, laughing as he pours.  ""This happens all the time, we're used to it."" The police chief, Major Aref al-Janabi, radios to his men to respond.  Al-Janabi, like so many others, is frustrated with the lack of support from Baghdad.  Earlier, he had taken us to the front lines, a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions.  He says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for ISIS positions, but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements. More explosions follow in the distance. We're quickly moved out and leave the town, heading back towards the bridge and the long, snaking lines of refugees. An ambulance passes us, trying to force its way through the crowds.  The swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours -- not surprising given Essawi's dire assessment and warning. ""Ramadi is under siege from all sides,"" he'd told us earlier, anger mixed with an air of resignation. ""I consider the city to have fallen."" He claimed that 150,000 have fled, scoffing at statements from Iraqi officials in Baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to Ramadi.  He has yet to see them.","Families flee parts of western Iraq amid continuing onslaught from ISIS fighters .

Radcliffe runs down The Mall hand-in-hand with a fellow runner as she  takes in the atmosphere . But a time of 2:36.55 in her final competitive marathon is not to be sniffed at for a 41-year-old with a left foot as flexible as a rod of iron who described herself as ‘unfit and unprepared’ for the race. It is well inside 2:42.00, the IAAF qualifying standard for the Rio Olympics next summer. The British Athletics standards – which are likely to be sterner - have yet to be announced but it is immaterial as Radcliffe maintained this was it for her elite running career. ‘My body can’t train at this level any more,’ she said, ‘In Kenya [where she did a winter training camp] I pushed myself too hard and I broke down. I’m sure the magic of London helped me run faster than I would or should have been capable of.’ Radcliffe was due to give a BBC interview on Tower Bridge with Denise Lewis but the former heptathlete could not keep up. ‘She ran alongside me for a little bit but it was too loud and I didn’t want to stop because I was worried my foot wouldn’t be able to start again.’ Instead of running with the elite women, Radcliffe chose to take off with the 37,000-strong mass field .

As much as my body wanted it to finish I didn’t want it to end.’ In the women’s elite race, the attention pre-race was centred on four Kenyan women but Tigist Tufa broke away from the pack to become only the third Ethiopian to win the London marathon, after Derata Tulu in 2001 and Aselefech Mergia in 2010. Tufa, who the bookmakers judged a 25/1 shot before the race, crossed the line in 2:23.22 with two-time winner Mary Keitany 18 seconds behind. Ethiopia’s Tirfi Tsegaye was third in 2:23.41.

2766,"A couple who were told their severely disabled baby may die within hours of being born are celebrating her first birthday. When Sonia Morales was pregnant, her daughter Angela was diagnosed with anencephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born without parts of their brain and skull. But Sonia and her husband Rony, who live in Providence, Rhode Island, decided to 'keep her no matter what.' A couple who were told their severely disabled baby may die within hours of being born are celebrating her first birthday. Pictured: Sonia and her husband Rony, with Elizabeth, four, and Angela, now one . Elizabeth with her little sister. Angela has anencephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born without parts of their brain and skull - many newborns with the condition die soon after birth . Angela, who weighs only 16 lbs., celebrated her first birthday on March 23 alongside their four-year-old daughter Elizabeth. They were prepared that they may lose Angela from the moment she was born. 'When we went to the hospital, I thought I was going to be saying hello and goodbye on the same day,' says Sonia to People. 'We sang her a song that we made for her. It was during an ultrasound that Sonia Morales was told her daughter was not developing properly . Sonia says her daughter is aware that her little sister is sick, but just wants to spend as much time with her as she can . Everyday the family sing a birthday song, along with a birthday cake and a prayer as they celebrate Angela's life . After her birth, doctors told the family it was a critical period, but a week later they were thrilled to bring her home. The family have been celebrating every day with Angela since as they know life could be short for their sick daughter - they have a birthday cake and sing every day. 'Every day is truly a gift. She knows how much she is loved,' Sonia says. Anencephaly occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy. During that time, the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus. This process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies, resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain, skull and scalp. Babies born with anencephaly are usually blind, deaf, unconcious and unable to feel pain. They are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer. The rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births. Sonia says her other daughter is aware that her little sister is sick. She wrote on a Facebook post: 'From the beginning we tried to explain that her baby sister would have to go to Heaven with Jesus because her head was not fully formed. She took it in a very natural way. 'Eli was always there close to help me with her sister. Rony and I, did not want her to see Angela's head without the hat that covered the hole in her head. 'But one day I did not locked the door when I was doing Angelas's dressings and I was washing her wound. Elizabeth's first reaction is priceless, ""Mami she has hair, she is beautiful!"" 'Elizabeth didn't see Angela's deformity she saw her sister, she saw her beauty. 'And from that day she was the one who helped me clean the opening. 'Passing me the gloves, tape and bandages. She told me, Angela is different from other children but who cares mommy she is beautiful God made her like this.' Angela has part of her brain missing and one of her eyes is shut, but she has made progress in the past year. Sonia posted a video online which shows her moving her head as she calls her voice and she recognizes those familiar to her. Although her future is still uncertain the family are making the most of their time with her and take her on family outings. The Morales have created a GoFundMe page to help with medical expenses. They have also made a Facebook page which offers updates on Angela's health as well as offering support to other families whose children have anencephaly. Sonia wrote on the Facebook page: 'I am a happy mom. She gives us so much joy to our family.' Although her future is still uncertain the family are making the most of their time with her and take her on family outings .","When Sonia Morales was pregnant, her daughter Angela was diagnosed with anencephaly .

10613,"(CNN)It's a warm afternoon in Miami, and 35-year-old Emanuel Vega has come to Baptist Health Primary Care for a physical exam. Dr. Mark Caruso shakes his hand with a welcoming smile. Vega, a strapping man with a thick black beard, is feeling good, but he came to see the doctor today because his wife thought he should -- she even made the appointment. It is free to him under his insurance policy with no co-pay, as most preventive care is under the Affordable Care Act. Vega is one of more than 44 million Americans who is taking part in a medical ritual: visiting the doctor for an annual physical exam. But there's little evidence that those visits actually do any good for healthy adults. Caruso listens to Vega's heart and lungs, checks his pulse in his ankles and feels around his lymph nodes. He also asks Vega about his exercise and sleeping schedule and orders blood and urine tests. As long as everything checks out, Caruso asks Vega to return for another exam in a year. Vega says he definitely will. It was a positive experience for both doctor and patient, and they're not alone; 92 percent of Americans say it is important to get an annual head-to-toe physical exam, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation). And 62 percent of those polled said they went to the doctor every year for their exam. But the evidence is not on their side. ""I would argue that we should move forward with the elimination of the annual physical,"" says Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, a primary care physician and a professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School. Mehrotra says patients should really only go to the doctor if something is wrong, or if it's time to have an important preventive test like a colonoscopy. He realizes popular opinion is against this view. ""When I, as a doctor, say I do not advocate for the annual physical, I feel like I'm attacking moms and apple pie,"" Mehrotra says. ""It seems so intuitive and straightforward, and [it's] something that's been part of medicine for such a long time."" But he says randomized trials going back to the 1980s just don't support it. The Society for General Internal Medicine even put annual physicals on a list of things doctors should avoid for healthy adults. One problem, Mehrotra says, is the cost. Each visit usually costs insurers just $150, but that adds up fast. ""We estimate that it's about $10 billion a year, which is more than how much we spend as a society on breast cancer care,"" Mehrotra says. ""It's all a lot of money."" And then there's the risk that a doctor will run a test and find a problem that's not actually there. It's called a false positive, and it can lead to a cascade of follow-up tests that can be expensive and could even cause real harm. Dr. Michael Rothberg is another primary care physician and a health researcher at the Cleveland Clinic. He generally avoids giving physicals. ""I generally don't like to frighten people and I don't like to give them diseases they don't have,"" Rothberg says. ""I mostly tell my family, 'if you're feeling well, stay away from doctors. If you get near them, they'll start to look for things and order tests because that's what doctors do.' "" ""The flip side of that is if you're not feeling well, don't keep it to yourself. Don't minimize it. Don't pretend it's not there,"" he adds. Rothberg says he still has patients who always schedule an annual exam. For those patients, he skips the physical aspects of the exam and focuses instead on talking to them about their dietary and exercise habits, possible risks, age-appropriate vaccinations and any screening tests they may need. The guidelines discouraging annual physicals are aimed specifically at asymptomatic adults. Dr. David Fleming, president of the American College of Physicians, says it's important for elderly patients to be seen on a regular basis, to ""do a full assessment of everything -- how they live at home, if the conditions are safe, are they at risk of falling? They need a flu shots every year. This is a population where it's definitely indicated."" Back in Miami, Caruso is also well versed in the research on annual physicals, but he still believes in them. ""I think having a look at somebody is worth its weight in gold,"" he says. It's an important part of developing a relationship with a patient, he says, and there have been countless times when he's found real problems during an exam just like the one he gave to Vega. ""What if Mr. Vega had had a lump or bump that wasn't right?"" Caruso asks. ""What if when he had his shirt off, Mr. Vega said, 'Oh yeah, I forgot to mention this spot on my chest,' and it ended up being a melanoma we discovered early?"" And Vega did end up needing a little help -- he has a bad back that's landed him in the ER several times. Caruso was able to link him up with a back specialist to help him manage the problem.

They eat and live like cats and dogs, grow up learning how to hop, let their owners give them regular baths, sneak into the kitchen for snacks, take naps and mingle with other pets. Samantha Wills, from Williamstown in South Australia, welcomed the joey dubbed 'Crash' into her family after he was thrown from his mother’s pouch when she was hit by a car. ‘He looked battered, bruised and I really didn't think he was going to survive when I found him but with a lot of love, care and research, I got him back to great health,’ Ms Wills told Daily Mail Australia. Crash, who lives in SA, taking a nap with one of Samantha Wills' children after a long day of adventures . Suzie Nellist from Queensland said her pet Wally the wallaby and her cat get along very well . Lunchtime: Wally the wallaby being fed milk from the bottle (left) and a cheeky snack in the kitchen (right) Nine months on, the adorable marsupial lives a comfortable life with the Wills family and even attends most of their social events. ‘Crash goes away on holiday with us,’ Ms Wills said. ‘He has been to two weddings, a ninth birthday party and has even kayaked up the Murray River and the sea at Wallaroo and attended my children's school for show and tell. 'He used to visit my nan, who adored him, at a nursing home and he would also keep all the elderly people entertained in there - they all loved him. 'When nan passed away a few weeks ago, Crash went to her funeral.' While kangaroos are known to grown as big as 1.8 metres tall, Ms Wills said her family are enjoying their time with Crash while he is small. 'We're not sure what the future will bring because he will get really big,' she said. Bath time: Wally the wallaby going in for his regular baths .

Crash going on his regular adventures with the family (left) and being carried in a sports bag (right) Despite the roo going on regular trips with his family, Ms Wills said she does get the unusual stares from other people in public. 'They do give us weird stares but most of the time they would all come over for pats and to ask lots of questions,' she said. 'It really is amazing to see how many people instantly love him and want to pat him. 'Country people don’t get the opportunity to get up close either when they drive down the road and see them all in the paddocks.' But it the Wills family are not the only ones who have a pet kangaroo in their home.

Suzie Nellist, from Innisfail in far north of Queensland, found Wally the wallaby on top of his dead mother on the side of the road and took him home to nurse him back to health. 'It's quite common to find abandoned wallabies where I live,' Ms Nellist told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I've seen him recover and grow so big and strong, which inspired me to find a way to do it full-time,’ The 20-year-old wildlife carer who has cared for injured and orphaned wallabies for many years said they make great pets but only in the right circumstances. ‘Roos make great companions if they are given a choice to be free and quite often, they still hang around,' she said. ‘We have quite a large space for our guys, and they all get along great with my dog and cat. They become quite close and adapt to them like a mob. ‘It's really quite amazing to see them all sleeping in the backyard or eating all their dinner together.

While it sounds too easy to keep a kangaroo in the backyard, Ms Nellist said it's hard work and they're not always easy. 'They are like naughty toddlers,' she said. 'We had to put locks on all our cupboards and put our bins up high to keep them from tipping bins over and breaking into cupboards. 'Wally actually learned how to break into our cupboard to get to the sweet potatoes. 'They have a beautiful little cheeky character, but it can be hard work if you don't have the time or patience for them.

For people interested in owning a kangaroo, Ms Nellist said she would definitely recommend it to everyone . For people who are interested in owning a pet kangaroo, Ms Nellist said she would definitely recommend it to everyone. 'I think everyone needs to see the natives from a different perspective,' she said. 'People often get the impression they are a pest, or they are inadequate but they have the right to be here. 'They definitely deserve more respect than what they get, and I think if more people got up close to them, and saw them the way I see them, they could really appreciate them. Ms Nellist advises: 'If anyone does see a dead wallaby or kangaroo on the road, it's important to check their pouch for any joey and call the local wildlife carer if you do find one.

11293,"Scotland will definitely become independent one day, Nicola Sturgeon vowed today as she again refused to rule out a second referendum on breaking up the Union. The SNP leader said the 'direction of travel' was towards independence, as she set out her demands for her to support Ed Miliband if Labour falls short of a majority. But David Cameron warned of the 'frightening' prospect of the SNP holding Labour to ransom and demanding they ditch new roads and hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scroll down for video . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the 'direction of travel' was towards independence butPrime Minister David Cameron warned nationalists would use a Labour government to break up the Union and punish other nations . The Tories have unveiled a new poster showing Nicola Sturgeon pulling Ed Miliband's strings, which could mean more taxes and borrowing, while England, Wales and Northern ireland suffer . David Cameron has urged people to vote tactically, to keep a Labour-SNP government out of power. The Prime Minister issued a plea to Ukip and Lib Dem voters to lend their support to the Tories to prevent 'Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes'. Writing in the Sunday Times, the Tory leader said: 'A vote for any of the other parties makes it harder for Conservatives to get those 23 constituencies we need to form a majority government. 'Vote for Ukip or the Liberal Democrats and you take Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon a step closer to Downing Street — and our government, economy and country a step closer to chaos. 'So if you are considering voting Ukip or Lib Dem, I urge you to think of the chaos of a weak Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes. Only a Conservative vote in your local constituency will keep Ed Miliband and the SNP out and secure Britain's future.' Mr Cameron warned that with the SNP calling the shots, the rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, 'wouldn't get a look-in'. Both Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon have ruled out a formal coalition, with SNP ministers sitting in a Labour Cabinet. But Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly offered to work with Labour to 'lock' the Tories out of power. In September's referendum, 55 per cent of people voted against independence, but since then support for the SNP has soared. Latest polls suggest more than half of Scots plan to vote for the SNP, robbing Labour of dozens of seats north of the border. On BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Sturgeon would only say: 'I have no plans for another referendum at this stage.' But she added: 'I think Scotland will become an independent country one day. I think that's the direction of travel. 'Whether there is another referendum, and whether Scotland becomes independent is not a matter for me to decide. It is a matter for the Scottish people to decide.' Ms Sturgeon tried to play down the idea that the SNP would attempt to cause disruption at Westminster to further its goal of independence. 'I've got to persuade people that the SNP in the House of Commons after the election will not be any kind of disruptive force. We want to be constructive, to get better politics coming out of the Westminster system. 'As long as Scotland remains part of the Westminster system, it matters to people that we get good decisions out of that system, and I want the SNP to play a positive part in improving politics at Westminster for people right across the UK.' But Mr Cameron warned that if Labour is forced to rely on the SNP to pass laws and budgets, England, Wales and Northern Ireland will pay the price. Ms Sturgeon tried to play down the idea that the SNP would attempt to cause disruption at Westminster to further its goal of independence . Mr Cameron warned that with the SNP calling ths shots, the rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in . The Prime Minister, who described himself as a 'fundamental believer in the United Kingdom', told Andrew Marr: 'This would be the first time on our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country. I think that is a frightening prospect. 'People thinking in their own constituencies, is that bypass going to be built, will my hospital get the money it needs? Frankly this is a group of people that wouldn't care about what happened in the rest of the country. 'The rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in. 'That is the prospect we face if we don't get the majority Conservative government that is in our reach.' A recent TNS survey showed the SNP has almost doubled its lead over Labour in a month, with 52 per cent now backing Ms Sturgeon with only 24 per cent of Scots planning to vote for Mr Miliband . Last week Labour announced plans for a freeze in rail fares, paid for by scrapping road upgrades on the A27 along the south coast and the A358 in Somerset - both in Tory and Lib Dem seats. Mr Cameron said: 'The SNP is a party that doesn't want to come to Westminster to contribute to a government, it wants to come to Westminster to break up our country. 'You have to ask yourself, if you are in a voter in England, in Wales or in Northern Ireland, would these people care at all about what happens in my life or my constituency. And the answer is no. 'We have already seen Labour cancelling important infrastructure projects, in the south of England, in the South West of England, the A27… . 'They've said we wouldn't go ahead with those, they've cancelled, they've said we don't care about these things because they don't matter to us politically.

9360,"A  reporter once described it one of the 'dirtiest, wildest, toughest neighborhoods anywhere', though the grime around New York City's Times Square has since been replaced with the shine of electric advertisements and thousands of tourists. But photos of the area's 'notorious' dive bar,Terminal, have been preserved by the bartender and photographer who served drinks to pimps, prostitutes and destitute New Yorkers floating around the Port Authority bus terminal. Sheldon Nadelman, 80, who worked at the bar from 1973 to 1982, would meet and photograph the women as they came in at eight in the morning for three shots of cognac before going out to walk the streets. Photos taken from behind the bar at Terminal Bar, a 41st Street and 8th Avenue watering hole open until 1982, show a side of Times Square that has disappeared in the glare of Coca Cola advertisements . Sheldon Nadelman, a young bartender who is now 80, would watch as prostitutes hid behind newsstands and trash cans to avoid being seen. Reflections in the bar windows show pictures of boxers hung on the walls . Terminal Bar, which was located on the block now occupied by the New York Times headquarters, saw an combination of people floating around the Port Authority bus terminal . Nadelman, whose thousands of photos have been digitized by his son Stefan, watched as pimps and prostitutes gathered outside of his bar . 'It was a zoo. You had every hustler, every pimp, every wino. They were all at Terminal Bar,' Nadelman told the Daily Mail Online by phone. His amateur work, which includes thousands of portraits from the period, often focused on the street trash can he could see from the bar, where a cross section of Times Square's hustlers and homeless stopped for a rest. Nadelman, who lived in Greenwich Village before leaving the city to raise his children, snapped genuine  shots as sex workers hid behind newsstands to avoid police at the terminal across the street and watched as the lives of many who entered his bar slowly fall apart. 'The street eats them alive,' Nadelman said of his bar's clients, which included a combination of gay men, cross-dressers, actors and alcoholics all mixing together in a small patch of Midtown Manhattan not yet known for commercial glitz. The photographer said that women would come in to the bar early in the morning to get shots of cognac before going out to work the streets . The area around Times Square used to be known for violence and prostitution. Though there are still sex shops on 8th Avenue, grime in the area has been replaced with chain restaurants and tourist attractions . Nadelman's voyeuristic shots were often captured through the open door of his bar, allowing him to see a candid cross section of 1970s New York not available in project that took place over a shorter time period . Hundreds of photographs from the 1970s and early 1980s capture the mood and fashion of a New York in Midtown Manhattan that no longer exists . He would hang portraits of his customers on the wall, and made a little pocket money selling them or $5 a pop. Three decades later, the photographer now lives in southern New Jersey, and visitors to Times Square are more likely to be asked if they want to see a Broadway show than propositioned by a prostitute. However, his son Stefan decided to digitize his father's shots, keeping alive the stories of bar regulars and passersby that would be lost to history as selfie sticks became more common in the neighborhood. The trash can outside of Terminal on 41st Street and 8th Avenue played a supporting role in the stories of many passersby, who used it as a place to rest . Nadelman, who would meet many of the pimps, prostitutes and others who gathered around Terminal Bar, watched as many of their lives took turns for the worse . The bar's clients included a combination of gay men, cross-dressers, actors and alcoholics who mingled together in a neighborhood described as the 'dirtiest, wildest, toughest anywhere' A prostitute nicknamed Red (right) was one of the luckier stories captured by Nadelman. She received enough money to stop working on the street after her 'john' (left) died . While the fate of many of its customers is uncertain, Terminal Bar itself closed in 1982 after Nadelman's father-in-law and bar owner Murray Goldman decided that $125,000 a year rent was too expensive. Nadelman then completely took himself out of New York  'It was like circumcision, gone', he said of his move to suburbia, and now views his time at the bar as a 'different world', though is reminded of the 70s by the occasional sex shop still on 8th Avenue. The building where Terminal once stood is now occupied by the New York Times, which paid $24million for its first year at the 41st and 8th Avenue juncture in 2010, according to Bloomberg. Art gallery owners have talked of bringing Nadelman into the new, expensive New York for a show, though he is uninterested in recognition and says going back to his old stomping grounds is a 'schlep'. The photographer keeps his photos, as well as his paintings, up on the walls of his house  for his personal recollections. 'Yesterday, it's always on my mind,' he said. Terminal Bar closed in 1982, when Nadelman's father-in-law Murray Goldman decided that he did not want to pay $125,000 per year in rent . 'It was a zoo. You had every hustler, every pimp, every wino. They were all at Terminal Bar,' Nadelman said . The area formerly occupied by the dive bar is now taken up by the New York Times, which pays millions of dollars to lease floors on a block that includes upscale grocery store Dean & Deluca . Times Square is now often mobbed with tourists from all over the world and features advertisements on bright electronic screens rather than signs for dingy bars .

2721,"Did you blink? There was a total eclipse of the moon on Saturday - but it was an unusually short one. The lunar event - where Earth's shadow completely blocks the moon - lasted only five minutes, making it the shortest eclipse of the century, NASA said. The so-called 'blood moon' could be seen by billions of people across the western U.S., Canada and Australia. Scroll down for video . Blood moon: Skygazers in the western U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand were treated to a total eclipse of the moon before dawn on Saturday (pictured over New Zealand) The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. The next one will be visible from Europe. The best spot this morning was at the Mississippi River, where spectators caught the entire five minutes of the orb around 5am PT, astronomers said. Sky-gazers in the Midwest and East Coast only caught part of the lunar show. The eclipse could also be seen in its entirety on Saturday night from eastern Australia, New Zealand and Japan. But observatory staff in Sydney were unable to see the eclipse due to cloudy weather and instead wrote on Twitter: 'Our live feed from the Griffith Observatory [in America] is showing gorgeous totality pink!' Don't blink! The moon may have shone red for three hours but it was only visible to citizens for five minutes (pictured over New Zealand) On the west coast of North America, the total eclipse — what astronomers call totality — began shortly before 5am PT . They accompanied their tweet with a picture of a bright pink moon. 'Blood moon' refers to its orange or red appearance, which is the result of sunlight scattering off Earth's atmosphere. Whether the moon appears dark red, copper, bronze or another shade depends on several factors including the amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere. Unlike more lengthy eclipses, the moon in this case only skimmed the upper part of Earth's shadow. Normally, the moon passes through the middle of the shadow, making the eclipse lasts longer. Sydney Observatory astronomer Andrew Smith said before the event: 'Some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality, which will make it the shortest since 1917, but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592.' 'Blood moon' refers to its orange or red appearance — the result of sunlight scattering off Earth's atmosphere, seen here in Santa Barbara . Unlike solar eclipses which require eye protection, you only need clear skies to view this lunar eclipse (pictured over Santa Barbara) Whether the moon appears dark red, copper or bronze depends on several factors including the amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere . As well as California, the eclipse could also be seen in its entirety on Saturday night from eastern Australia, New Zealand and Japan . The total lunar eclipse is observed above cherry blossoms in Shiraishi city, Miyagi district, northeastern Japan on Saturday . Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington added that it was the changes in colour that makes lunar eclipses so interesting. The full eclipse of the moon in September will be visible across the U.S. and Canada, as well as western Europe and Africa. 'Totality' will last around an hour and 20 minutes. But those who missed out in Australia will have to wait until January 31, 2018, for the next lunar eclipse. Unlike solar eclipses which require eye protection, you only need clear skies to view a lunar eclipse. A pair of binoculars or backyard telescope will enhance your view, but are not necessary. Japanese sky-gazers caught the moon when it was still white and out of the Earth's shadow . It is the third of four consecutive lunar eclipses separated by six months - a tetrad - which is very rare . Atmospheric: The sky (pictured in Japan) burned a deep red as the gleaming orange light shone through the clouds . In New York, where the sun was rising, the sky glared orange from the reflection of the sun's rays from the moon . The full moon is seen over the Santa Monica Mountains in Topanga, California, shortly before it turns red during the lunar eclipse . The moon is seen behind downtown high-rise buildings during the shortest total lunar eclipse of the century before dawn .

Now 34, a very gaunt Xie, who did not know what year it was when he was rescued because he was so isolated from the outside world, said he was hit with a hammer, never fed properly and beaten daily. Rescued: Xie Shisheng, who was just 16 years old when was imprisoned by the mill owner, was found by police in small dark room by police . Government authorities in the city of Qingyuan in the north west Guangdong province were tipped off about an illegal cotton mill. When they arrived at the mill in Qing Cheng District on Wednesday, they found large quantities of fake cotton goods and another more unexpected discovery. Inside a locked room officials found Xie  making cotton products. Speaking with a stammer, he said that in 1997, aged 16, he voluntarily went to Qingyuan with the mill owner, but was locked away in cramped living quarters and treated like a slave. Each day he was given a huge workload and was beaten. 'They would often force feed me horrible things and when I would struggle they would hit me in the head with a hammer,' Xie said. 'The female owner would often urinate on me.' Tortured: Now 34, a very gaunt Xie said he was hit with a hammer, never fed properly and beaten daily . When government officials arrived in the Qing Cheng District on Wednesday, they found large quantities of fake cotton goods . Xie, originally from Jiangxi in the south east of the country, said that every few years the owners would change the place of work but that he was always imprisoned in a dark room without any natural light. In fact neighbours said they always had an inkling someone was being held illegally in the building.

1553,"Colin Hendry appears at Blackpool Magistrates' Court where he admitted a drink driving charge . Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry has been banned from driving after he was caught drunk at the wheel of his Ford Focus. Hendry, 49, rowed with his then girlfriend Sarah Kinder before embarking on a drinking session which led to him driving through Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, where he was seen speeding, a court heard. Police followed his 10-year-old car as it crossed double white lines while the father-of-four attempted to drive home. Now the former Premier League player who had spells with Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City, must travel around on his bike, a court heard. Hendry of  Lytham St Annes, admitted drink driving on the town's Church Road on February 21. He was almost twice over the legal limit after drinking in a Lytham cocktail bar. His lawyer Gwyn Lewis told Blackpool Magistrates' Court that Hendry's current income was 'meagre' and he asked for extra time for his client to pay fines and costs until he can start taking his offshore pension in mid May. Mr Lewis said Hendry, who is out of work, no longer wished to pursue a defence of 'special reasons' as a forensic report revealed he would have been over the limit at the time he was breath tested and there was no evidence that his drinks had been spiked. Peter Bardsley, prosecuting, said that a police officer in an unmarked car saw Hendry at 1am pulling away from a junction at speed. He followed Hendry who drove above a 20mph limit and then a 30mph limit sometimes going as fast as 50mph. The officer ordered Hendry's car to stop and smelled alcohol on him. He was arrested and a breath test revealed 63 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath. The legal limit is 35. The court heard Hendy, who played for Blackburn Rover and Manchester City, was seen driving at up to 50mph while drunk after a row with his then girlfriend Sarah Kinder . Argument: Hendry said he had rowed with Sarah Kinder, pictured. He has subsequently been arrested for allegedly breaking a restraining order . Mr Lewis said: 'Mr Hendry is a fit man and regularly cycles. He has not drunk for seven weeks before he was arrested. Playing career: Hendry captained Scotland and played for Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, and Rangers . 'He started what some people call a dry January following the death of his wife in 2009.' 'However he was in an emotional state that day-and he decided to take a drink. However he knows what he drank and still cannot accept the reading from the breath test.' 'His finances are to say the least complicated. He was made bankrupt some years ago. His income is meagre until he can start taking his pension in mid-May.' Chair of the Bench Marilyn Padgett banned Hendry for 17 months. He was also offered a drink drivers' rehabilitation scheme which will reduce his ban by one third if he completes it. He was fined £110 and the magistrate said: 'We have based this on the lowest level and it will be deferred for six weeks to allow you to start your pension.' He was ordered to pay £200 court costs and £20 victims' surcharge. In 2010, Hendry was made bankrupt owing £2.2m to friends, family and the taxman. Last weekend he was arrested after allegedly breaking a restraining order which forbids him from contacting his beauty technician former girlfriend Ms Kinder.

1552,"Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself in 2012 after she was sexually assaulted at a party. Two of her attackers have finally apologized and admitted she was unconscious during the 'criminal act' Two teenagers have finally apologized for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl who later committed suicide after images of the attack were shared around her high school. The pair, who have not been named, admitted Audrie Pott was unconscious at the time and did not consent to their 'criminal acts' as they reached a civil settlement with her family. They also apologized for sharing false rumors spread around Saratoga High School in Northern California that 'served to shame and humiliate her'. The teenager fell asleep after drinking Gatorade laced with vodka at a friend's party in their hometown of Saratoga. She awoke to find her pants off and lewd comments scribbled over her body. Her family says she hanged herself days later after learning cellphone photos were taken of her during the assault and shared through text messages. Audrie's parents, Lawrence and Sheila Pott, filed a civil lawsuit against the boys to hold them more accountable for their actions. Their attorney, Bob Allard, said the parents decided to settle with one of the teens because he showed remorse and 'told the truth' about what happened to Audrie. Now the final two teens have reached an agreement after initially refusing to say sorry - reportedly paying $950,000 to the devastated family. As part of the settlement, they were also made to release a lengthy apology and will have to give presentations about 'sexting', sharing nude photos, 'slut-shaming' and the dangers of alcohol. The pair said:  'We apologize that we said things that made it seem like Audrie invited or encouraged these acts. 'We admit that we committed these acts and shared inappropriate images of Audrie to others. 'Audrie wasn't conscious during these criminal acts that we committed and did not consent to what we did.' They also apologized for false rumors that 'served to shame and humiliate her'. It continued: 'We would like every teenager out there to understand that words about someone's character can have a life altering effect. That taking advantage of an incapacitated human being is a crime each and every time. They also said they would participate and support a petition to to the Saratoga High School Administration to give Audrie an honorary diploma, because their 'actions contributed to prevent her from graduating. During a hearing on Friday, the boys stood up and apologized to the courtroom, including Audrie's parents, to mark the signing of the agreement. According to the San Jose Mercury, one of them said: 'I wish Audrie was still here, and I miss her a lot. She was a great person who didn't deserve anything that happened to her due to my actions. I apologize. I wish I could make it right.' Anger: Larry Pott and and Audrie's stepmother and his second wife Lisa, have finally settled their lawsuit against two of their daughter's attackers after one admitted and apologized . Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012 . Tormentors: The three teenagers (pictured with their faces obscured) pleaded guilty to sexual assault last year and were sentenced to 30-45 days in a juvenile detention facility . The second teen, who is now a senior at Christopher High in Gilroy, said that if he could, he would 'take back the pain and suffering I caused Audrie and the Pott family. This has caused a tragedy to all involved due to my actions.' He added: 'I will do everything I can to mentor teens to not do what I did in September 2012.' The teenagers also agreed to be interviewed in a documentary film already in production about the case. The three attackers, all classmates, were prosecuted in private juvenile proceedings and sentenced to between 30 and 45 days in juvenile hall. Two continue to attend Saratoga High, while the third transferred to high school about an hour south in Gilroy. Allard said that had the two other teens apologized, they might not have been sued. 'If they had simply knocked on the door of the Pott household, apologized, accepted responsibility and jumped headfirst into our quest to educate our youth by, for example, speaking at high schools about the mistakes they made and how this can be prevented, there would be no civil lawsuit,' Allard said. Audrie's parents led the campaign to pass a California law which allows prosecutors to seek harsher sentences for juvenile sex offenders who take pictures of their crimes and use them to bully the victims. The trio of teenagers whom Daily Mail Online is not identifying because they are minors, pleaded guilty in January 2014 and were sentenced to 30 to 45 days each in a juvenile detention facility. Pott, from Saratoga, California, hung herself September 10, 2012 - just eight days after the teens digitally penetrated her at an alcohol-fueled Labor Day party and took pictures of her in a compromised state. The 15-year-old girl felt humiliated after she discovered that the cellphone photos showing her naked body covered in lewd comments written in marker had been shared with students at her school. In February, Pott's parents tried to get all three expelled from their schools - which they returned to after their sentences. Cruel: Pott, right, was assaulted after a night of drinking and boys spread photos of the attack . They launched a petition on the site Change.org calling on the principals of Saratoga High School and Christopher High School to expel the three perpetrators responsible for Audrie's 'slut-shaming.' At a party in early September 2012, Audrie Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade and woke up without her shorts on, with her face painted black and with mocking comments written in indelible marker all over her body. Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault, which involved digital penetration, and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers. 'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident. She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos. 'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.' Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' Left behind: Audrie is pictured left with her father, step mother and half brother and sisters . Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house. In police interviews, the teenagers admitted to coloring half of her face black with marker, then pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals. They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images. Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school. She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images. 'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.' 'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body. She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her. 'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.' She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'","Parents of Audrie Pott reach financial settlement with remaining two teens .

In a 2012 video that was viewed millions of times online, grandmother Karen Huff Klein, 71, tried to ignore the boys calling her fat, ugly and poor but was seen wiping away her tears. Now one of the students involved in this verbal attack has been accused, along with two others, of forcing a special-needs student to drink urine from a toilet while holding his crotch at Greece Athena High School in upstate New York. The bullying was videotaped and posted on Snapchat, WHEC reported. Scroll down for video . Tormented: Bus monitor Karen Huff Klein, 71, was tormented by middle school students in Greece, New York in a difficult-to-watch 10-minute video in 2012. She can be seen wiping away her tears in the footage. Now, one of the students involved in this verbal attack has been accused of bullying a student with special needs . Mrs Klein, 71, (pictured this week) said that the middle-schoolers who verbally attacker her 'didn't learn any lessons' on hearing news of one of the student's alleged bullying this week . When she was informed of the bullying incident, Mrs Klein told WHEC this week: 'They didn’t learn any lessons from the other ordeal. I don’t think they ever will.' She also said of the alleged attack: 'Why did you [alleged bullies] do that, what possessed you to be so mean? 'And now with this, it is really obscene what they did, and it's like it's progressing rather that regressing.' Greece Athena High School was reportedly investigating the bullying internally after the Snapchat video was reported by other students. WHEC reported that the alleged attack could be a matter for family court but because the students were minors it would not reach criminal court. Daily Mail Online was awaiting comment on Friday from school officials. The students involved in the bullying have not been identified for privacy reasons. One student involved in the recent bullying had three years ago verbally attacked Mrs Klein when he was a 7th-grader. The sickening video, which was uploaded to YouTube by a concerned third party, saw an outpouring of support for the elderly woman and she received donations of around $700,000. At one point, Mrs Klein turns to the teens and says with arms folded: ‘Unless you have something nice to say, don’t say anything at all.' One of the kids responded: ‘Shut the f*** up,’ and then asked why there is water on her face. ‘Are you sweating?’ the student asked. ‘No, I’m crying,’ Mrs Klein said. The video showed the teenagers getting more and more crude. At one point, a student said: ‘You’re so ugly, your kids should kill themselves.’ Greece Athena High School in upstate New York (pictured) is reportedly investigating a sickening bullying incident involving a special needs student . One of Mrs Klein's sons had committed suicide around a decade before, msnbc.com reported. At the six-and-a-half minute mark, a student said: ‘If I stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like butter, because it’s all f***** lard.’ After the bullying was made public, the students responsible apologized to Mrs Klein. She responded: 'I want (the kids) to make sure they never do this again to anybody. I would like them to be kept off the bus for a year, and be forbidden to play any sports, at least for a year.' She added: 'They each try outdo the other. I don’t think they ever picked on the other kids… just me.'","In a 2012 video, bus monitor and grandmother Karen Huff Klein, 68, wiped away tears as she was verbally abused by middle school students .

8811,"A man has accidentally captured a bizarre clash between a kangaroo and a pair of domestic dogs that lasted for over nine hours. Melbourne-based Jon Czerniecki positioned trail cameras to spot deer on his grandparents' farm near Wangaratta, northeast Victoria, over the Easter long weekend. When he checked the nine hours of footage, Mr Czerniecki stumbled upon the upsetting spectacle, which shows the canines ganging up on the injured marsupial as it lies on its back. Mr Czerniecki has since contacted the local council and Parks Victoria in hopes of notifying the owners of the dogs about what they had done, but he claims they're unwilling to help. The disturbing nine hour vision shows the two canines ganging up on the injured marsupial as it lies on its back . Mr Czerniecki told Daily Mail Australia he had never spotted anything like it in eight months of using the trail cameras. 'I've seen plenty of animals but never any dogs. It's clear the kangaroo had a broken leg, and the dogs were just torturing it for such a long span of time.' He said he has contacted Parks Victoria and the local council in hopes of tracking down the owners of the dogs. 'They weren't having a bar of it because it happened on a private property. I figure it can't be that hard to track down the owners in that area,' he said. 'I think they should be told what the dogs were up to, but it's clear the authorities aren't going to help.'

4323,"Ten deputies have been placed on leave after a shocking video emerged showing them punching and kicking an alleged horse thief for two minutes following a chase through the California desert. In the video, captured by an NBC helicopter, Francis Pusok, 30, is seen falling off the horse he was suspected of stealing after being pursued several miles by the San Bernardino County officers. Seconds later, two deputies catch up to Pusok and stun him with their Tasers. They then stun him again, and again, as lies splayed face-down on the ground, with his arms placed behind his back. As the camera keeps rolling, the officers apparently kick the suspect in the head and crotch, before other deputies arrive on the scene. One clearly draws back his leg and swings it at Pusok's head. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocking: Ten deputies have been placed on leave after a horrific video emerged showing them punching and kicking (left) alleged horse thief Francis Pusok (right) following a chase through the southern California desert . Beating: In the video, captured by an NBC helicopter, Pusok, 30, is seen falling off the horse he was suspected of stealing. Seconds later, the deputies catch up to him and stun him with a Taser, before beating him (above) Chillingly, after the beating, a deputy whispered in the suspect's ear: 'This isn't over,' according to Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell, who said the man was left 'scared to death for himself and his family'. Now, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon has placed 10 deputies on paid administrative leave for their alleged roles in the graphic footage, which he said had 'disturbed and troubled him'. McMahon said the video, captured on Thursday, appeared to show an excessive use of force. He added that he was launching an internal investigation into the actions of the unidentified officers. 'I'm not sure if there was a struggle with the suspect,' he told NBC. 'It appears there was in the early parts of the video. What happens afterwards, I'm not sure of, but we will investigate it thoroughly.' In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office, McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave.' Earlier on Thursday, Pusok had allegedly fled by car after deputies had tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation. He later dumped the vehicle in the Hesperia area, it is said. Investigation: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon (pictured) said the video, captured on Thursday, appeared to show an excessive use of force. He added that he was launching an internal investigation . Paid leave: In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office (pictured), McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave' Couple: Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner (left), said her boyfriend (right) has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted he is a great father, and said she 'couldn't believe' the filmed attack . The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing, then reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, before being tracked down by deputies. In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing. The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch. As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head. Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Following the incident, two deputies were taken to a nearby hospital for injuries, including abrasions, a twisted knee and a back injury from being struck by the horse, the sheriff's office said. Chase: The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing,  reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, on Thursday, before being tracked down by deputies . Apprehended: In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing . Pusok was treated at the hospital for abrasions and bruising. He was then released to be booked on suspicion of felony evading, theft of a horse, possession of stolen property and reckless driving. After the video was broadcast by NBC, it sparked outrage on the Internet, with many users noting that Pusok was lying on the ground in a 'surrender' position when he was beaten by the officers. On Friday, Mr Terrell told KABC that the attack seemed never-ending. 'This is as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King. This was terrible. It kept going and going and going,' he said. Rodney King, who died in 2012, rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers following a high-speed car chase in March 1991. Although four officers were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and use of excessive force, they were later acquitted in a series of verdicts that are thought to have caused the 1992 LA riots. 'Surrendering': The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch . Huddled around: As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head. Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Also Friday, McMahon said an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions in the arrest of Pusok. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. 'I'm asking for some patience while we complete a thorough and fair investigation,' McMahon said. 'I am disturbed and troubled by what I see in the video. It does not appear to be in line with our policies and procedures. Hospitalized: Pusok (pictured) was treated at a nearby hospital for abrasions and bruising . 'I assure you, if there is criminal doing on the part of any of our deputy sheriffs or any policy violations we will take action.' The deputies were wearing audio recorders, but McMahon said he had not listened to them and the recordings will be part of the investigation. Attorneys for Pusok told KNBC-TV Friday as they left the jail that their client has a badly swollen eye, marks from the beating over his face and body, and is in pain. 'He remembers being beat, and he remembers that he wasn't resisting, that he laid still, he complied immediately. He says that he didn't even move a muscle because he didn't want to be continuously beat, yet it still happened,' said attorney Sharon Brunner. Ken Cooper, a use of force expert, said the deputies were clearly frustrated and appeared to take that out on the suspect. One, he said, appeared to be striking Pusok with the Taser. 'It doesn't look good. It looks like his hands are behind his back even when they're doing the blows,' Cooper said. 'The justification for using force is to gain compliance from the suspect, and the suspect seems to be complying. So what this looks like is those blows are not justified, they're not necessary and they're not professional.' Cooper said the officers should be disciplined, retrained to deal with stress especially, and the video should be used for department-wide training. He said the officers allowed their emotions and adrenaline to overtake their professionalism. But training helps 'inoculate' officers from responding improperly during high-stress situations. 'When chasing a fleeing suspect, in high stress, you have to control that. It's your obligation as a professional. You can lose it sometimes,' Cooper said. McMahon said deputies had previously been called to Pusok's home in Apple Valley, where he had allegedly made threats to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of family members. 'We were very familiar with his aggressive nature,' McMahon said. Comparison: On Friday, Pusok's attorney, Jim Terrell, told KABC that the attack was 'as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King'. King (left, after his beating) rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers (right) following a high-speed car chase in March 1991 . Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, said her long-term boyfriend has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted that he is a great father who did not deserve the brutal beating. 'I'm not going to stand here and say that he's perfect, because who is?' she  said. 'I couldn't believe it,' Bindner said after seeing the video. 'The first thing I said was 'they cannot do that.'' The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.","Deputies filmed chasing 'horse thief' Francis Pusok in the California desert .

1365,"(CNN)NASA says its Messenger space probe crashed into Mercury on Thursday after running out of fuel, ending a nearly 11-year journey that provided valuable data and thousands of photos. Mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of Mercury, as anticipated, at 3:26 p.m. EDT, NASA told CNN in an email. NASA earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet (16 meters) in diameter. The crash wasn't visible from Earth because it occurred on the far side of Mercury. Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6½ years before it started circling Mercury on March 18, 2011. It was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to the sun. It traveled about 5 billion miles -- a journey that included 15 trips around the sun. Spacecraft to make death dive into Mercury . The spacecraft was healthy when it crashed, but was out of fuel. When scientists determined there was no way to save it, they held a briefing this month to celebrate the mission's success. ""For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,"" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington. One of the mission's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. As the end neared, the probe sent back some final tweets thanking mission managers and counting down its final orbits. The Messenger mission is over, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And while the space probe won't be sending back anymore images, you can see Mercury with your own eyes. It's visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May.","NASA's Messenger probe smashes into Mercury, ending mission .

3965,"Modern humans have developed a reputation for being somewhat destructive and keen to separate themselves from the rest of the animal kingdom. However, a recent excavation of a cave in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain is suggesting our ancient cousins, the Neanderthals, were more in tune with nature. Archaeologists have discovered evidence that Neanderthals regularly inhabited the Cave of Llenes, near Senterada in Catalonia, around 200,000 years ago but were not alone. The fossilised remains of badgers were found in old dens within the cave alongside Neanderthal camps . The remains of other canivores including cave bears, hyenas, leopards, wolves and badgers have been found in the cave and were apparently also living there. While some of the bones may have been brought there by the Neanderthals themselves, it seems they were also sharing the cave with these other predators. Scratches on the walls and hibernations nests particularly indicate that cave bears spent a considerable amount of time there. Neanderthals, shown in the artist's impression above, may have lived alongside predators in a cave in Spain . Researchers found several cave bear fossils, similar to the one above, along with scratches on the walls and signs of hibernation nests that suggest they were living in the cave alongside Neanderthals 200,000 years ago . It is hoped the discoveries will help scientists learn more about Neanderthal behaviour and their relationship with the animals they co-existed with. ‘The excavations have documented regular visits by groups Neanderthals, probably related to hunting animals living around the cave.’ The researchers discovered large numbers of stone tools made by Neanderthals and evidence of camps that were made close to the entrance of the cave. They also found the fossilised bones of Bonal tahr – a species of wild sheep that became extinct in western Europe 100,000 years ago – which appear to have been hunted by the Neanderthals. The researchers also found traces of other ungulates including deer, rhinos and megaloceros - a giant species of deer that is now extinct. Neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago, spreading to inhabit much of Europe and parts of Asia, but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago. The reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated Homo sapiens. They were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age Europe. However, a series of discoveries are now putting Neanderthals into a new light. Stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination. A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France also suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices . A recent discovery by researchers at the Muséum National d'Histories Naturelle in Paris suggests that Neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them. They discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones. Many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments. Cross-hatched engravings found inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art. DNA analysis has also shown that Neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak. Eight talons found at a 130,000 year old Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia are also thought to be the world's first jewellery, and may have been worn as a necklace. Recent research has also suggested that Neanderthals may also have used  herbs to flavour their food. Neanderthals, like the one  above, may well have been the world's first gourmet chefs and made jewellery .","Fossils found in Cave of Llenes in Catalonia, Spain suggests Neanderthals lived  alongside other predators like badgers, bears, wolves and leopards .

The actor's enduring sex appeal may have been boosted by his aftershave, Eau Sauvage, which contained a potent chemical known as Hedione. Now scientists have revealed how this chemical activates the hypothalamus - an area of the brain responsible for triggering the release of sex hormones in women. Scroll down for video . It wasn't just Steve McQueen's rugged looks that sent ladies into a frenzy in the 1960s. The actor's enduring sex appeal may have been boosted by his aftershave, Eau Sauvage, which contained a potent chemical known as Hedione. Pictured is Steve Mcqueen starring in the 1965 film The Cincinnati Kid . Hedione - derived from the Greek word 'hedone', for fun, pleasure, lust - has a fresh jasmine-magnolia scent. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage, was the first to use it in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne, Paco by Paco Rabane and Chanel no. 19. The latest study shows how Hedione - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro-jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor VN1R in humans. This activates part of the hypothalamus - an area of the brain responsible for triggering the release of sex hormones in women. Hedione - derived from the Greek word 'hedone', for fun, pleasure, lust - has a fresh jasmine-magnolia scent. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage, was the first to use it in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne and Chanel no. 19. The study found that Hedione creates 'sex-specific activation patterns' in the tissue found in the nasal cavity which connects to the brain, according to a report in the Telegraph. Here Hedione - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro-jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor VN1R in humans. 'These results constitute compelling evidence that a pheromone effect different from normal olfactory perception indeed exists in humans,' says scent researcher Prof Hanns Hatt from Ruhr-Universität Bochum in Germany. Scientists analysed brain activity when a person smelled Hedione to find out how it changed their emotions and behaviour. They then compared the results with the effects caused by a common floral fragrance known as phenylethyl alcohol. Hedione triggered brain areas in the limbic system, which is responsible for emotions, memory and motivation, more effectively than phenylethyl alcohol. It also activated an area of the hypothalamus which releases sex hormones throughout body to turn people on. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage (left), was the first to use Hedione in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne and Chanel no. 19 (right) The German study found that Hedione activated a specific hypothalamic region, in women more strongly than in men. But scientists are still divided over whether humans can actually communicate via pheromones. In the animal kingdom, this kind of communication is widespread. Mice have around 300 different genes for pheromone receptors; in humans, probably only five of them are still functional. 'In the next stage, we want to find out which physiological and psychological parameters are affected when Hedione activates the pheromone receptor,' explains Hanns Hatt. 'We also have to search for scent molecules in bodily secretions, which resemble Hedione and activate the receptor. 'With its help, humans could actually communicate with each other.'","Actor was famous for wearing Christian Dior's Eau Sauvage aftershave .

6125,"(CNN)Americans on the United States' no-fly list will now be privy to information about why they have been banned from commercial flights and be given the opportunity to dispute their status, according to court documents filed by the Justice Department this week. The revised policy comes in response to a June ruling by a federal judge that said the old process was in violation of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process. The decision was part of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 Americans on the list. But the ACLU isn't satisfied with the government's new policy, outlined in documents filed Monday in federal courts in Oregon (PDF) and Virginia (PDF). ""After years of fighting in court for complete secrecy and losing, it's good that the government is finally now going to tell people of their status on the No Fly List,"" said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project and the lead attorney on the case, in a statement. ""Unfortunately, we've found that the government's new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it denies our clients meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing. The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again."" People on the no-fly list, managed by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the United States. The number of people on the list is classified. An official with knowledge of the government's figures told CNN in 2012 that the list contained about 21,000 names, including about 500 Americans. Before the change, American citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied aircraft boarding received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion on the no-fly list. Now, they'll be made aware of their status if they apply for redress, with an option to request further information. ""The U.S. government is making enhancements to the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to provide additional transparency and process for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been denied boarding on a commercial aircraft because they are on the No Fly List,"" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. In cases in which travelers included on the list request to receive or submit more information about their status, the government will provide a second, more detailed response, identifying ""specific criterion under which the individual has been placed on the No Fly List,"" according to the court documents. An unclassified summary of that information will be provided ""to the extent feasible, consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests at stake,"" court papers said. Those who appear on the no-fly list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing, with supporting materials or exhibits, and will receive a final written decision from the Transportation Security Administration. The 2014 ruling that prompted the policy changes had called for passengers on the list to be given the opportunity to dispute their status before a judge.","Americans on the no-fly list will now get info about why they've been banned from flights .

The Anthem of the Seas, which has 16 decks and can carry almost 5,000 passengers, towered over the Explorer of the Seas as it departed the Hampshire dock this afternoon. The cruise liners, which are both owned by Royal Caribbean International, will both be based in Southampton and serve Europe and the Mediterranean over the summer. As the season comes to a close, the Anthem of the Seas will then move to New York Harbour which will become its permanent home and allow it to regularly sail from Cape Liberty Cruise Port to Bermuda, the Caribbean, Canada and New England. The highly-anticipated new cruise ship, which was officially named earlier this week, is set to welcome more than 80,000 people on board this summer and bring an estimated £50,000 to the local economy. Featuring robotic bartenders, skydiving, circus training, surfing simulators, indoor bumper car racing, roller skating rinks, an adult-only spa, aerial observatory and 18 distinctive on board restaurants, the ship is widely classed as the next generation cruise liner. Meanwhile, the veteran Explorer of the Seas, which enjoyed its maiden voyage 15 years ago, has been given somewhat of a refurbishment and now also includes a surfing simulator, 3D movie cinema and additional restaurants. The ship, which has 15 decks and a capacity of more than 3,000 passengers, also boasts a rock-climbing wall, ice-skating rink and full-size basketball and will serve northern Europe, the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands until September.

11395,"Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man vs PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the third in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I look back on one of the most anticipated events of the 20th century which divided a nation. THE SECOND FIGHT OF THE CENTURY . Joe Frazier v Muhammad Ali . Madison Square Garden, New York . March 8, 1971 . The Greatest had been stripped of the world heavyweight title he had won so sensationally against Sonny Liston but it was the reason for that decision which added cultural significance to what was to be a magnificent fight. Sweat sprays off Muhammad Ali (right) as Joe Frazier collects his jaw with a strong left in 1971 . Ali and Frazier at Madison Square Garden, New York, on March 8, 1971, was the second 'Fight of the Century' Ali's evasive abilities and speed, such as this swerve from a Frazier hook, kept him in the fight . Smokin’ Joe was the undefeated two-belt champion but it was this proud black man’s bizarre adoption by America’s conservative right which stoked the fires of society still further. Muhammad Ali had been banned from boxing for three-and-a-half years for refusing induction into the US military to fight in Vietnam – but as a consequence become the darling of the young, the black and the Civil Rights movement. Joe Frazier found himself unwittingly the standard bearer for the white establishment. Ali fanned the flames by labelling the simpler man who would become his arch-rival an ‘Uncle Tom,’ the most wounding insult for an African American . There was a foretaste of the current scramble for Mayweather-Pacquaio tickets. Woody Allen was one of the very few celebrities give a complimentary seat and other famous names had to work their way into the 20,000 crowd at the Garden. Frank Sinatra persuaded Life magazine to give him a camera and send him as their ringside photographer. Fast-talking Ali offensively labelled Frazier an 'Uncle Tom' due to the support he got from white conservatives . Referee Tony Perez, widely believed to have acted leniently in Ali's favour, orders the pair to their corners . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . Author Norman Mailer reported on the fight. Actor Burt Lancaster picked up a TV microphone for his only stint as a colour commentator. Artist Leroy Neiman sat at his easel painting Ali and Frazier as they fought. This was one fight in which the action fully lived up to the hype and its place in history. Ali came out fast to dominate the first three rounds. Frazier, encouraged by catching Ali with the last punch of the third, launched an attack to the body in the fourth which brought him into the ascendancy. Ali’s speed of hand, dancing feet and combination punching kept him in a fight in which he was taking increasing punishment – along with a little help from referee Arthur Mercante who declined to call a knock down when Frazier sent him crashing in the eighth. Ali is laid out on the canvas as Frazier is send to the corner before a long 10-count in the 15th round . Somehow, heroically, survived the especially torrid 11th and 14th rounds. Still some good judges had it close going into the 15th and last round. There all argument was ended. Frazier caught him with the most wicked of all those trademark left hooks and this time there was no denying a count which appeared to edge a fraction longer than the stipulated ten seconds. Ali rose to his feet. Unsteadily. His jaw grotesquely swollen. Again his courage carried him to the bell. The decision was unanimously in favour of Frazier, although both men went to hospital. Frazier got the unanimous decision from the judges but both men went to hospital after the epic bout . Very late that night word spread through New York’s animated bars that one of them had died. Frazier checked out early, quietly. Ali pronounced the rumours of his passing to be premature. Their trilogy was born. They were to fight twice more and on one of those occasions each would come close to death again.","Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao's fight will be the richest ever .

From getting stopped and searched for drugs in Mexico, to hijacking tuk tuks in India, the fun-loving broker has had many adventures beyond London's exclusive SW3 postcode. While you may expect him to enjoy the best luxury hotels around the world, the carefree traveller says he often packs the bare minimum and even enjoys staying in the odd Travelodge. Jetsetter: Andy Jordan from Made In Chelsea has enjoyed the best hotels around the world, but also enjoys a stay at Travelodge . Sat in Andy's London flat at the start of the bank holiday a travel edition of 'Would You Rather' kicks off proceedings. 'I don't think I've played this sober before,' he says, before revealing how he prefers action holidays to lying on a beach. 'I once took a girl on holiday to Morocco for her birthday,' he said when asked about the most romantic place he has taken a female companion. 'It was a bit awkward as we were together but broke up just before, but both still wanted to go. 'What she didn't realise is I had booked it based on the best surfing spots in the area and turned up at the airport with my surfboard. 'She was livid!' Action man! The singer loves to keep active on holiday and aims to surf in the Arctic one day . The singer released his album, Geography, last year and in the title song he sings about falling in love at first sight on London's Underground. The ladies of London will be delighted to know he is completely open to finding love on trains. 'I had my first 'train encounter' when I was 14 and I chatted to this girl for five hours, all the way from Oxford to Bodmin Parkway,' he explains. 'It was so incredible we even kissed when I got off and met up that evening on the beach. 'I am a big believer in that kind of thing.' Sun loving! The latest holiday the Chelsea boy went on involved the cast from the TV series. Their trip to Barbados was shown on the season opening episode this week . Most of the singer's future holiday plans involve ticking surfing spots off his bucket list. 'I want to surf in the Arctic, it's becoming a big thing and you can surf between glaciers with Patagonia wetsuits that let you go in four degree water.' Of course the Chelsea boy had a gap year, funded by doing a telesales job in his bedroom in pajamas, before surfing every day for six months around the world. When asked if he would rather join the Mile High Club and be caught or never join at all, his response is instant. 'Join it! Hands down! Just to clarify I am not currently a member of it.' Andy's favourite hotel is the Tryall Club in Jamaica. He stayed at the Round House and brought the whole of his family . His favourite place to stay is in the Tryall Club in Jamaica's Montego Bay. The country club retreat is where he has previously shared the sumptuous Round House property with his family. 'It's very cool as it has a huge turret and a dining room table that seats 18 people and the staff are amazing. 'I got blamed for drinking all the rum but it was actually the butler.' Andy also loves to check into London hotels such as the Corinthia, just for fun (as you do) and the Londoner believes the hotel service in the capital is among the best in the world. More rivalry! Andy Jordan and Jamie Laing set their sights on Made In Chelsea newcomer Jess Woodley . But it's not all sumptuous surroundings and butler service, Andy reveals he is also a fan of Travelodge. 'When I was on tour I took our whole team there and they do a great bed,' he said. 'Even Mark Francis would stay there, he is actually an extremely chilled traveller.' If the singer could pick anywhere in the world to busk for a day, it would be Union Square in New York in summer. 'I probably wouldn't get to play for very long as I would get chatting to someone, go for a coffee and end up exploring the city. 'Actually, an hour outside Wall Street and you would have about $400 and could leave it there anyway!' If Andy could take one of the Made In Chelsea stars on a desert island with him it would be Jamie. 'He would freak the most for sure, but he's such a positive person he would just think screw it and have a fun time. 'He's not a fan of organised fun so this would be the perfect place for him, but he would definitely start freaking out with then sun went down.' The TV series is on its ninth season, and can be seen on E4 on Mondays at 9pm . Hijacking tuk tuks! Just one of Andy's many holiday adventures when he has been outside of his London SW postcode . The Chelsea star enjoys going abroad as he is less recognised and does not have to act in such a refined way. 'In India I said to one of the tuk tuk drivers that I would pay extra if I could drive. 'It was a really great way of getting back from the temple to our hotel. 'But it was night and I nearly hit a cow, which are sacred there, and I had to swerve to miss it and a couple of people fell out!' His latest holiday was with the Made in Chelsea gang, and they flew with British Airways  from London Gatwick to Barbados. The gorgeous stars' holiday was shown on the season opening on Monday this week and Andy was clearly a fan of the company.

The 25-year-old lashed out and hit a photographer on the forehead with a plastic bottle before hurling abuse at him. Woman charged with having sex with a dog has lashed out at a photographer and hit him over the head . Jenna Louise Driscoll has been charged with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug and unlawful wounding . Ms Driscoll was arrested on Friday afternoon after she turned up at Stafford police station to fulfill her regular bail conditions. Police had allegedly issued a warrant for her arrest after she failed to appear in court on seven charges of supplying or trafficking drugs, one charge of unlawful wounding and three charges of bestiality. According to the Courier Mail, Ms Driscoll pleaded guilty before Magistrate Bronwyn Springer for failing to previously appear in court and was fined $250 for the offence . She was released on conditional bail, which requires her to report to police, abide by residential conditions and not speak to the complainant. Police found the videos of Ms Driscoll allegedly having sex with a dog while investigating text messages on her mobile phone for allegedly dealing cannabis in October. She fronted Brisbane court on Saturday for failing to previously appear on April 7 . Police were carrying out checks on Driscoll's phone for suspected drug trafficking when they discovered the three videos which allegedly show her having sex with a dog . Ms Driscoll was charged last year with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug. ‘This isn’t something you’d normally expect, it’s quite unusual. The last case I can recall was a few years ago, it certainly isn’t something we hear reported often,' said Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland. Driscoll was also charged with two counts of possession of an item used in the commission of a crime and three counts of supplying. Police prosecutor Sergeant Scott Pearson said Driscoll had allegedly been dealing cannabis to friends. Text messages showed that Driscoll had arranged for 113 grams of the drug to be sold for $1,150 and on another occasion 85 grams for $900, according to Sgt Pearson.

945,"Together they wrote a string of chart-topping hits for some of the world's biggest stars and created the memorable theme tune of Australian television soap Neighbours. Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, who were married for more than three decades, were dubbed 'Mr and Mrs Music' after composing for artists including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Scott Walker, Shirley Bassey and Petula Clark. So when Trent died last month aged 74 after a long battle with cancer, Hatch was expected to be at her funeral to say a final goodbye. True, their marriage had ended in divorce, but they had a daughter together and one of the most successful creative unions in showbusiness. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Hatch was banned from the funeral by Trent's second husband, Colin Gregory, who today accuses the composer of breaking his wife's heart. Scroll down for video . Tony Hatch (left) and his former wife Jackie Trent (right) wrote a chart-topping hits for the world's biggest stars but he was banned from her funeral last month . He says that not only did she never forgive Hatch for the infidelity that ended their marriage, but she believed to her dying day that he had denied her the credit she was due for some of their compositions. Although they were responsible for about 400 songs together, they had been mired in a long-running feud over seven that Trent claimed she co-wrote. After years of pressure, says Gregory, Hatch agreed to acknowledge Trent's part and her name now appears against some of the songs on the Tony Hatch website. But on other songs, Hatch is the only composer credited. Gregory told The Mail on Sunday: 'Yes, I banned Hatch from attending Jackie's cremation.' The 71-year-old former policeman, who married Trent in 2005, said: 'It might seem petty and churlish of me because, whatever anybody says, Hatch and Trent are welded at the hip for all the wonderful work they did together. 'I would never contest that. Jackie never contested that. But her firm words to me were, ""I hate him for what he did to me and for what he's still doing to me."" 'I couldn't and wouldn't contact Tony Hatch myself. It would be inappropriate because we're in litigation.' Instead, he passed the message to Trent's son from her first marriage, Darren, who Hatch had adopted when they married. Gregory said: 'Darren rang, giving it the smooth patter of, ""Oh, they had such a lovely warm life together"", which they did not. And when he said he wanted to invite Hatch to the cremation, I said quite firmly, ""No. If he turns up, I shall call the police."" 'Suffice it to say that Jackie would not want Tony Hatch anywhere near her final moments on this earth. He and his wife were specifically banned from attending her funeral, or anything in connection with it. 'Jackie always told me, ""No service – just you.""' The cremation was held on the Spanish island of Menorca, where Trent lived with Gregory. It is also home to Hatch and his wife. Hatch, 75, clearly got the message, writing on his Facebook page on the day of the funeral: 'Today was final departure day for her soul but I was BANNED by her husband Colin Gregory from attending the crematorium.' Gregory now plans to bring Trent's ashes home to Britain for a memorial service in May at her local parish church in Chesterton, Staffordshire. Much of Trent's wealth, he said, had recently been eroded – not least by the legal battle with her former husband over the songs, which Gregory claimed has cost about £20,000. It's a far cry from 1965 when Hatch and Trent met and fell in love. Hatch was already married and the couple embarked on an affair before marrying the next year and going on to become one of the most successful teams in music, earning millions of pounds. But if Hatch, the son of a pianist, who grew up in Pinner, North West London, and Trent, the daughter of a miner from Newcastle-under-Lyme, made a fortune, they seemed to have trouble holding on to it. The couple moved to Ireland at one point because of its tax benefits for artists. Hatch wrote the theme tune to Crossroads and is still remembered by many as the 'Mr Nasty' judge on 1970s TV talent show New Faces. In 1982, the pair moved to Australia and were later asked to write the theme song for Neighbours. Their marriage ended abruptly and abrasively back in Britain at Trent's 55th birthday party in 1995, when Hatch confessed that for years he had been in love with one of his wife's friends. Trent was devastated. Gregory plans to persevere with Trent's legal battle over the disputed songs: 'not for financial gain – Jackie was getting her share [of songwriting royalties] – but because it was her dying wish that he finally admitted she co-wrote those songs.' Hatch declined to comment.","Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent wrote chart-topping hits for musical superstars .

1970,"Warrington crashed to a third straight Super League defeat and could be in trouble with the Rugby Football League following crowd trouble in the Cheshire derby. The game was stopped for eight minutes after a flare was thrown from the stand housing visiting fans but Widnes maintained their focus to run out 30-10 winners and maintain their impressive form at the Select Security Stadium, where they have taken seven points out of a possible 10 this year. Warrington's losing run is their worst since 2009 and their misery was compounded by the loss of winger Matty Russell with a leg injury. Following a delay caused by a flare, Widnes condemned Warrington to a third defeat in a row . Widnes, hammered by Salford in their previous outing, were boosted by the return of influential captain Kevin Brown from a three-match absence with a hamstring injury and the Wolves had no answer to his half-back partnership with Joe Mellor. Yet Warrington could hardly have made a better start, with England forward Ben Westwood collecting a rebound from Gareth O'Brien's high kick to score the opening try after only five minutes. It was eight minutes before O'Brien could add the goal as the game was stopped to enable stewards to clear the flare from the pitch and remove the offenders. Once back under way, the game flowed from end to end but, while Widnes scrambled superbly to keep their line intact, the visitors' defence cracked three times as the Vikings found some real potency in their attack. Dangerous full-back Rhys Hanbury got centre Cameron Phelps through a gap for the first try on 10 minutes and, after Russell had hobbled off, his opposite number Stefan Marsh gathered Brown's pinpoint kick for the first of his brace of scores to give his side a lead they never looked like relinquishing. Widnes lost Phelps to injury on 29 minutes, which paved the way for 19-year-old Matt Whitley to make his debut, but they struck again three minutes before the break when Mellor's cut-out gave Marsh a clear run for his second try. Jack Owens managed just one conversion and also missed a long-range penalty attempt on the stroke of half-time but Widnes took only five minutes of the second half to extend their lead. A touchline dash from Owens created the position for hooker Lloyd White to burrow his way over from dummy half for the softest of tries. It went from bad to worse for the visitors when Westwood was sin-binned following the concession of three consecutive penalties by his team and the Vikings immediately took advantage of the extra man when Brown went through a gap for a fifth try. Owens converted both tries to make it 26-6 but Warrington pulled a try back on 64 minutes through makeshift centre Ben Currie after the home side were down to 12 men with Danny Tickle in the sin-bin for a foul on Daryl Clark. Widnes fittingly had the final say when Owens went over three minutes from the end for his side's sixth try.","Warrington slipped to their third straight defeat in the Super League .

8469,"Homesick Sam Tomkins insists it is not a foregone conclusion that he will return to Wigan when he cuts short his New Zealand Warriors stay at the end of the season. The 26-year-old England full-back is interesting his former club, where his brother Joel plays, and Wigan have an option to bring him back to the DW Stadium. When announcing his departure barely 18 months ago, Wigan announced they could re-sign Tomkins on a 'defined salary' on his return to Super League. Sam Tomkins has been released by the New Zealand Warriors after feeling homesick . And while Tomkins says it would 'be nice' to resume his Wigan career, he is tentatively exploring alternative options too. Asked where he would be playing next, Tomkins said: 'I've not worked that out just yet. The first thing was to sort it out over here that I could go back. 'Hopefully that'll be sorted in the not-too-distant future.' Wigan is where Tomkins launched his career, playing for the club from 2008 to 2013, so it is inevitable he should be linked with last season's Grand Final runners-up. 'That's where my brother's playing and that's where I'm from, but I'm open to other places. I'm just trying to work out what will be the best option for me,' he said. 'Wigan would be nice but I know it's not the only team I can go to.' Before the announcement on Wednesday morning that Tomkins will be on the move, Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan told Wigan Today: 'If he became available we would be very interested. 'We've got the first option. If it gets to the point where he is available it is in our hands. And I'll be delighted if that was the case.' Tomkins has been open with his current club about the reasons for wanting to leave. Rather than not settling into the New Zealand game, it is being apart from his family and friends that has been niggling away at Tomkins, unsettling him and leaving him longing for life back in the north of England. He told Sky Sports News: 'I've enjoyed every minute of being amongst that group but New Zealand is pretty far from Wigan, where all my family live, so I want to be back in England around my family. Tomkins celebrates winning the Super League Grand Final with Wigan in 2013 having spent five years with club . 'I'll be two years I've been away and to be able to go back and be around family and friends is what I'd rather be doing next year.' A replacement for Tomkins has already been found by New Zealand Warriors, with Kiwi international Roger Tuivasa-Sheck agreeing a three-year contract that will take effect from next season. Tuivasa-Sheck will join from Sydney Roosters, with New Zealand Warriors head coach Andrew McFadden describing the 21-year-old on Wednesday as 'a wonderful talent and a fantastic signing'. That has cleared the way for Tomkins, currently sidelined with a minor knee injury, to depart without causing excessive disruption 12 months before the end of his three-year contract. Tomkins joined the Warriors for a world record transfer fee - thought to be in the region of £700,000. 'They invested a lot into me to get me over here which I appreciate,' he said. 'They handled that brilliantly when I was coming and again equally so when I've asked if I can leave. 'It was tough because I feel like I owe them something and hope I can pay them back with another big year this year.' New Zealand Warriors managing director Jim Doyle said of Tomkins: 'He came here excited about testing himself in the NRL and also experiencing living in a new country but, in the end, Sam has found it too much of a challenge being away from home. 'It's disappointing that it has come to this but reluctantly we have accepted there is no option but to allow Sam to return to England.'

5709,"An terrified asthma sufferer was left coughing up blood after accidentally inhaling an earring into her lungs. The 41-year-old woman was getting ready for a  party to celebrate the New Year when she started to wheeze. Worried her asthma would get worse and ruin the festivities, she reached into her bag for her inhaler, according to doctors writing in the journal BMJ Case reports. Her blue salbutamol inhaler was uncapped in her bag, and she heard a ‘coarse rattle’ when she shook it. Despite this, she ignored the noise, believing it was due to a loose connection inside the device. The 41-year-old Australian woman had a medical emergency on New Year's Eve after inhaling an earring into her lungs. An X-ray shows the earring lodged in her right bronchus - the airway leading to the lungs . Doctors put a thin tube with a camera on the end known as an endoscope into the woman's lung, which showed the earring was covered in mucus (pictured) She took a deep inspiration, but immediately felt a painful scratch in her throat. She began coughing up blood, wheezing and became short of breath, and was rushed by ambulance to the A&E department of St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, the report said. When she arrived, doctors ordered a chest X-ray, and saw something was wrong straight away. There was a mass that had ‘features consistent with a stud earring’, and a CT scan confirmed the earring was stuck in the woman’s right bronchus, one of the two main airways leading to the lungs. Doctors prescribed antibiotics to prevent any infection and then put a long, thin tube with a camera on the end into her throat - in a procedure known as an endoscopy. They were then able to examine the earring and remove it. They found large amounts of mucus around the earring, which was ‘the body’s attempt to expel the foreign body’ Dr Lucinda Blake, one of the doctors who treated the woman, told LiveScience. Alison Hall, 48, almost choked to death when she swallowed a false nail that shot out of her inhaler when she took a puff . If they had waited to remove the earring, the woman's body might have healed over the earring, embedding it within the bronchus, Dr Blake added. The woman made a full recovery, but in the report, doctors said her case highlights the need for people with asthma to be told about the dangers of storing their inhaler without a cap. Writing in the report, doctors concluded: ‘The importance of replacing caps on inhalers when not in use is illustrated and should be encouraged when inhaler technique is taught or reviewed.’ The news comes after MailOnline reported on the case of Alison Hall, 48, who almost choked to death when she nearly swallowed a false nail that had shot out of her inhaler when she took a breath. Ms Hall, 48, was at work when she felt her chest tightening and took out her blue salbutamol inhaler. She took a sharp breath and felt something shoot to the back of her throat where it became lodged. The mother-of-one ran outside in a panic when a neighbour came to her rescue and began pounding her back before calling 999. After five minutes of choking, a false nail finally came loose from the back of her throat and fell out onto the pavement. She believes the nail may have worked its way inside the inhaler through a gap at the top, and is now urging others to check their inhalers before use .","Australian woman felt a wheeze and took a breath on her uncapped inhaler .

4419,"Edwin 'Jock' Mee, (pictured outside court at an earlier hearing) allegedly targeted 11 cadets as young as 15, during the army interview process . An army recruitment sergeant got a teenage cadet pregnant after raping her during a campaign of abuse against female recruits, a court heard today. Edwin 'Jock' Mee, 45, allegedly targeted 11 cadets, aged between 15 and 25, on a military base in Croydon, south London, during the army interview and screening process. Southwark Crown Court heard he had a preference for vulnerable black women born overseas, who he isolated and 'kept' to himself so he could sexually abuse them. Many of his vulnerable victims were threatened with deportation if they did not submit to his sexual demands. One of the women, a virgin in her early 20s, fell pregnant when Mee raped her in a locked waiting room, jurors were told. She was in the UK on a student visa and Mee told her she needed to renew her passport and asked if she worked as a prostitute in the UK, jurors heard. He became 'aggressive' and looked down her top and rubbed her thigh while she was taking a test, it was claimed. After raping her, Mee told her she was a 'sweet child', jurors heard. Doctors found that she had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy for which she was operated on after collapsing in hospital. When she called Mee to explain what had happened, he allegedly replied 'I thought you were safe' and never spoke to her again. On another occasion he raped a 19-year-old from Sierra Leone after asking her for sex on the basis that he would get her a passport in return. 'He pressurised her to the extent that she felt she would be compelled to submit to his demands,' Rosina Cottage QC said in opening the case to the jury. 'He told her that she had control over her status in the country.' Mee raped her, before forcing her to perform a sex act on him, it was said. 'He told her that if she said anything, no one would listen to her, she would not have a job, she would have nothing,' Miss Cottage said. The divorced father-of-five denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration, which are said to have happened between October 2010 and September 2011. Mee, formerly of Croydon but who now lives in Glasgow, wore his grey hair in a pony tail and dressed in a smart suit and tie as he listened intently while Miss Cottage opened the case. She said the attacks had been an 'abuse of trust and power by this defendant in order to bully and groom young women'. He would 'gauge their vulnerability' and speak to the women about sex, touch them and in the most serious instances rape those over whom he had established control, Miss Cottage said. She added: 'A number of the complainants in this case were young black women, born outside the United Kingdom. 'Whether the defendant believed that this gave them a vulnerability in relation to their immigration status, or gave him an excuse to pretend that he had some power over them, the inference that the prosecution say can be drawn is that he deliberately targeted these young women.' She told the court Mee, known to many as 'Jock', was employed as a recruiting Sergeant with the British Army at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office (ACIO) in Croydon. 'His job was to screen cadet applications, interview those applicants and support their application through the process of attaining certain fitness levels and tests,' she said. 'Each of the complainants in this case was a cadet whose application was in the charge of this defendant.' She explained that the interview involves a three-part process, starting with a meet and greet, then a more personal interview with questions about family circumstances, motivation and commitment. The third interview, known as a confirmation interview, should be conducted by a different person from the first two, but the Scottish officer ignored the system, jurors heard. 'Each of the complainants seems to have been kept by him, to himself. Every interview, every appointment,' said Ms Cottage. One girl was just 16 when Mee allegedly slapped her bottom and when she said she didn't like it he told her: 'It's you who needs the army'. Ms Cottage said: 'Initially he appeared professional, but then started to talk about his wife and telling her about personal matters. The divorced father-of-five (pictured leaving court yesterday) denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration, which are said to have happened between  2010 and 2011 . 'He then wanted to ask her about her private life and whether she had a boyfriend. He asked her if she had body piercings and asked to see the piercing in her stomach area. 'She told him she was uncomfortable with this line of conversation and then he asked her if she would go and have a coffee with him. 'After she left she had a call from the defendant on a mobile phone asking her whether she had thought about his offer of coffee.' A week later the girl returned to the office to book the British Army Recruitment Battery - a computer based test and it was then that he allegedly slapped her bottom. The woman decided not to pursue a career in the Army 'because of the defendant's behaviour'. Giving evidence behind a curtain, she told the court that Mee explained during their first meeting that his wife had cheated on him. Another of the complainants broke down in tears as she gave evidence where she claimed that Mee 'made a joke' about her quiff hairstyle during a visit  to the recruitment centre with her mother. Jurors were told Mee had a preference for vulnerable black women born overseas, who he  'kept' to himself so he could sexually abuse them . She explained to the court from behind a screen that during her first meeting with the sergeant, when she was around 19, after she applied to join the army online and was invited for an interview with Mee in 2011. He allegedly asked if she would date people of other races because the Army 'doesn't stand for racism'. On another visit, her mother told the recruitment officer that she was 'worried' about her daughter joining the Armed Forces. Sobbing, the witness, who is now 23, told the court that Mee had replied jokingly, and added: 'He said that I would attract the Taliban with my hair.' Under cross-examination by Lisa Wilding QC, for the defence, she later admitted that the sergeant had joked instead that she would 'scare the Taliban off' with her hair. On a separate occasion, the complainant went to the centre to carry out some physical training, which she admitted struggling with, and Mee asked her into his office. He ordered her to do some sit ups while he held her ankles, it was said. 'I lay down, he held my ankles and I did some sit ups,' she said. 'I didn't want to do it and he was like, reassuring me because I had a skirt on.' She only managed 10 sit ups and Mee told her to attend a training session the following Thursday. The witness, who said she was the only woman, added: 'After the session finished we went back to his office, he said I needed to practice more and improve my fitness. 'When I was leaving he hit my bum when I was walking out the door. I was quite shocked, I didn't know what was going on. I just wanted to go and I did.' Later she claimed to have contacted Mee to say that she had decided not to join the Army because of the 'physical aspect of it'. She said she did not tell anyone about the smack on the bottom until police sent a letter to her house. Asked why she had not spoken about the incident with her mother, she said she was 'kind of embarrassed'. The Scotsman listened to the evidence of his alleged victims with the aid of a hearing loop. Ms Cottage said: 'This is a pattern of sexual, bullying behaviour that was repeated again and again to the female cadets to make them feel that he had power over them and control over their future.' He was British Army recruiting sergeant at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon (pictured) in the Careers and Information Office . The youngest alleged victim was just 15 when she went several times to the recruitment office. He asked her for a date and tried to kiss her on the lips in a corridor, but she turned away and he 'got her on the cheek', the court heard. On Thursday afternoons there were fitness assessments at Croydon Athletics Arena for up to 30 cadets supervised by two staff members, it was said. A number of Mee's alleged victims attended the regular Thursday training sessions, the court heard. Ms Cottage said: 'Sergeant Mee regularly stayed the latest of all the officers. The ACIO is closed to members of the public at the weekends, but occasionally the defendant was seen on the premises at weekends. 'A fellow officer, Stuart Conroy noticed he would conduct interviews with applicants out of hours and particularly remembers the defendant interviewing a young woman who Sergeant Conroy had interviewed earlier in the day,' she said. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The trial, which is expected to run for six to eight weeks, continues.

10299,"Row: Tinie Tempah pictured performing at an 'intimate gig' in Canterbury last night, where he arrived late and then played just two songs . Fans of rapper Tinie Tempah were left furious when the star turned up hours late to his own 'intimate gig' and only performed two songs before leaving. Music lovers paid nearly £40 to see the singer perform in Canterbury last night - only to wait for more than three hours for him to arrive. He then spent just a few minutes on stage, playing two of his songs before telling the crowd 'See you on tour' and leaving. The club which hosted the event has apologised to the audience and accused Tinie of breaking his contract with them. The event was advertised as 'an exclusive and intimate gig with one of Britain's most talented performers', with tickets starting at £30 plus booking fees. Some fans are believed to have paid more than £100 to meet Tinie, 26, whose real name is Patrick Okogwu and who is best known for his 2010 hit Pass Out. Ticket-holders had been warned that they would not be let in if they arrived after 11pm - even though Tinie was not there until at least three hours later. One member of the audience told MailOnline that she stormed out in disgust when the star failed to turn up until after 2am, and then stayed in a VIP area meeting fans for another hour. 'We were told we needed to be there by 11, but he didn't turn up until well past two,' said the 20-year-old student, who did not want to be named. 'Me and my friend left after three and he still hadn't played. 'We weren't the only people who left early, a lot of people left. People weren't happy.' Fans who stayed for the late-night performance were treated to just two songs before Tinie walked off stage, telling the audience: 'See you on tour.' Venue: Bosses at Club Chemistry said they would seek a refund from Tinie's management . One ticket-holder wrote on Twitter today: 'Clearly success doesn't equal class, Tinie Tempah showed how little he cares about his fans in Canterbury last night.' She added: 'He didn't deliver on his promises to the club, half-heartedly performed two songs rather than a full set then left.' A spokesman for Club Chemistry told MailOnline that Tinie had breached his contract for the event - and claimed that at one point he threatened not to play a single song. 'We have never been so utterly let down or disappointed by someone we were so excited about,' she said. 'There was nothing we could do. At one stage his manager actually told us he was not going to perform at all!' Success: Tinie Tempah pictured in 2011 after winning two Brit awards for his debut album . Organisers apologised to those who had bought tickets, saying in a statement: 'We are as disappointed as you. We were promised a two hour set with DJ Charlesy that included a decent performance from Tinie Tempah, as well as meet, greet and photos. 'It was all a massive let-down. We have lodged a formal complaint with his management and have demanded your ticket money back. 'Club Chemistry is committed to delivering quality artists and entertainment and it would appear that some people are not as dedicated to the cause as we are.' The club said that it would make sure members of the audience are 'compensated' and promised to keep them updated. Representatives for Tinie Tempah failed to return a request for comment on the row.","EXCLUSIVE: Rapper was booked to play 'intimate gig' at club in Canterbury .

1685,"Wolf Hall writer Hilary Mantel's award-winning second novel Bring Up The Bodies has been renamed for the American stage. The bestselling author, who once pledged not to dumb down her work ahead of its BBC debut, has revised the theatrical adaptation of her Tudor novels for a run on Broadway. In preparation, the title of her second book Bring Up the Bodies has been ditched in favour of the simpler 'Wolf Hall II'. Booker Prize award-winner Mantel, who has been reworking Mike Poulton's stage version, has also cut 'a lot of repetition' to create a tighter, better play. Scroll down for video . The bestselling author has revised the theatrical adaptation of her Tudor novels for a run on Broadway (pictured is Ben Miles as Thomas Cromwell and Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn) With more than 1,000 pages of historical drama, the story of the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell - who goes from a Blacksmith's son to one of the most powerful men in Tudor court - was never a simple read. The plays, produced by the Royal Shakespeare company and London's Playful Productions, will open at the Winter Garden Theatre in Times Square tomorrow and features the original British cast as well as director Jermey Herrin. And Mantel is convinced it will be a hit on Broadway. Warning: Hilary Mantel said she believed that the Broadway version of her books will be a hit . The British cast, including Miles as Thomas Cromwell and Paul Jesson as Cardinal Wolsey, will be going over to the U.S. as they prepare for the Broadway adaption which opens tomorrow . Nathaniel Parker, who won an Olivier award for his role as Henry VIII in the stage version of Wall Hall, told the Evening Standard: 'The play is better now than it was in London. 'Hilary has had a go at re-working it and she's cut a lot of repetition out and brought in her own words. 'I think audiences will love it.' The story was recently brought to the small screen in the BBC adaption starring  Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Mark Rylance as his adviror Thomas Cromwell. The mini-series received rave reviews when it aired earlier this year, and was dubbed BBC 2's most successful drama in a decade after drawing in four million viewers. Critics praised its story, acting and historical accuracy as makers went to such great lengths to recreate the Tudor period they used only candlelight to illuminate night-time scenes, filmed on location using special cameras. Actor Damian Lewis played Henry VIII in the hit television adaptation on  BBC of Mantel's award-winning story . Mantel, who saw sales of her books boosted by the adaptation, had said ahead of the BBC version that she refused to 'dumb down' to suit a broad television audience. The author had warned the adaption was 'complex', and she would not reduce it to 'clichés and over-simplifications'. The plays, written by Mike Poulton, sold out at Stratford-upon-Avon and quickly transferred to London, where they received critical raves, broke box office records and triumphed as the West End's biggest hit plays. Reprising their performances from the London production, Ben Miles as Cromwell, Nathaniel Parker as Henry VIII and Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn will be going over to Broadway. Mantel is currently writing her third novel in the Cromwell trilogy titled The Mirror and The Light.","Hilary Mantel has been tweaking stage version of Wolf Hall for Broadway .

1126,"Pete Evans has been slammed by medical professionals for promoting fluoride-free water . Health Minister Jillian Skinner has slammed celebrity chef Pete Evans for promoting fluoride-free water, saying he is putting people's health at risk with his extreme views on diet and lifestyle. It comes after concerned medical professionals  described Evans' standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice after he revealed his family also steers clear of consuming Australian tap water. Ms Skinner said she was 'highly disappointed' to see the My Kitchen Rules judge use his power as a high profile media personality to influence in areas he had no expertise, in which she has refused to watch his reality cooking show. 'Here we are spending a lot of effort and energy in educating people about the value of fluoridation, about the fact that there are no risks associated with ­vaccination, or very low risks, and that there is no connection between vaccination and autism, and it is countered by a celebrity who knows nothing from a specialist point of view,' she told The Sunday Telegraph. 'I'm highly disappointed that they would use a platform of cooking. That is totally inappropriate and quite disturbing, which is why I won't watch those programs anymore.' Evans' has responded to the Health Minister's concerns, saying he would like to discuss the benefits of water fluoridation. 'I welcome the opportunity to ­discuss the value of fluoridation with Ms Skinner, but ask that she, or any other party, does not misrepresent my views, opinions or beliefs.' The revelation follows after Evans threw his weight behind an anti-fluoride campaign where he proudly wore a 'Fluoride Free WA' t-shirt on Facebook to promote the Perth-based lobby group's cause. Health Minister Jillian Skinner has slammed celebrity chef Pete Evans for promoting fluoride-free water . Evans has also been under fire for endorsing the Paleo diet which cuts out dairy, cereal and processed meats .

'Alkalised water (maybe I just should've just said filtered water?) - we have a portable mineral pot ($500) water filter which rids tap water from potential carcinogens (chorine, chemicals, bacteria etc),' he said in a post on his Facebook page. Evans and his family don't drink tap water . 'I realise there's plenty of controversy around alkalised water, but I would rather choose this option over drinking tap water or bottled water, as it works out cheaper in the long run, and is environmentally friendly.' Australian Medical Association Victorian president Tony Bartone hit back at the outspoken chef telling Daily Mail Australia that Evans needed to stick to what he does best. 'All evidence at this stage both reliable studies and research from universities, the World Health Organisation, and by the Australian Dental Association points to the fact that basically fluoridation is an important public health initiative - it does prevent tooth decay,' Dr Bartone said. 'Celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the Stone Age.' 'People like this are using their fame and influence in areas that they have no expertise - obviously a top class chef but when it comes to scientific research and understanding - they are lacking.' Evans has previously been slammed for his endorsement of the controversial Paleo diet, which his family abides by, that includes meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit but excludes dairy or cereal products and processed food. 'I'm occasionally ridiculed or accused of ignorance because I choose to eat and feed my family what I believe to be a nutrient dense diet,' he said on his Facebook page. 'I can't help but find it so bizarre as to why some people find my food choices so offensive?' He says his decisions are an important part of being a parent - adding that 'ignorance is not bliss'. 'I'm a father and I take that privilege very seriously, so for me striving for optimum health and trying new things whenever possible, so that I can be a responsible role model for my daughters and still be able to surf right up until the end, is the ultimate goal,' he posted.

The My Kitchen Rules judge (pictured with fellow judge Manu Fieldel left) thinks it is bizarre that some people find his food choices so offensive . However, Dr Bartone sees Evans' stance as abusing his high profile media personality. 'It is influencing vulnerable others - people who are time-poor - and will unfortunately just look at celebrity endorsement and think it must be good and follow the argument without delving into the facts, he said. 'It affects the health message we are trying to impart on our patients and the community at large - especially in times when know that health and well-being is crucial and key to a number of illnesses and health factors that have a huge cross burden on society.'","Celebrity chef Pete Evans strongly endorses fluoride-free water .

180,"Robbie Knievel has been arrested for allegedly driving under the influence in Butte, Montana - the town his daredevil father Evel Knievel helped make famous. Knievel, 52, was speeding in an SUV on Tuesday evening when he rear-ended a Honda, causing a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles, police said. No one was injured. After the crash, Knievel drove off but his car was found nearby and he was seen walking about a block away, according to Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich. In court: Robbie Knievel, pictured in court on Wednesday, was arrested for DUI in Montana after crashing into another car on Tuesday evening and setting off a chain-reaction crash involving two other cars . Officers noticed that he had a bloody lip and smelled of alcohol, but he refused to perform a breath test and so officers got a search warrant to take a blood sample, the Montana Standard reported. Knievel was booked into jail. On Wednesday, he made his initial appearance in Justice Court. He has been in the area, where he has family, for a couple of weeks, authorities said. Skuletich says Knievel invoked his rights to an attorney but didn't give officers a name. The son of the famous daredevil Evel Knievel has previously admitted to being an alcoholic and pleaded guilty to DUI in South Dakota in August 2013. Like father like son: Robbie is pictured jumping 21 Hummers at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2008 . Icon: American daredevil and entertainer Evel Knievel poses for a portrait before a stunt in 1976 . In that incident, he drove his vehicle into two motor homes as he left a campground and a blood-alcohol test suggested he was nearly three times the legal limit. He received a suspended jail sentence and paid nearly $600 in fines. His driver's license was also suspended for 30 days. Following the arrest, he spoke with 'TMZ Live' and admitted that he had an alcohol problem. 'I'm a frickin' drinking, driving daredevil,' he told the show. 'I ride motorcycles and I friggn' drink and ride … that's my deal.' They also asked him how he would feel if he hurt someone while he was behind the wheel. 'I shouldn't be drinking and driving 'cause I could kill somebody,' he said. 'And you know what, it would be better if I killed myself.' Together: The two Knievels are pictured together in 2006 - the year before Evel passed away, aged 69 . Knievel appeared in his father's stunts as a child and has continued working as a daredevil in his own right, while his older brother, Kelly, overseas the Knievel brand. Among his most famous stunts, Robbie Knievel, a father-of-two, jumped over the Grand Canyon in May 1999 - succeeding where his father had failed years earlier. To complete the jump, which was televised by Fox, he soared 228 feet (69 meters) across a narrow part of the canyon on his a 500 cc motorcycle. Evel Knievel, who famously jumped lines of cars and buses, and attempted to hurdle sharks, canyons and anything else, passed away in 2007, aged 69.","The daredevil, 52, 'was speeding in an SUV when he rear-ended a car and set off a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles on Tuesday'

4810,"A historic SpaceX launch that was set to take off today has been scrubbed due to bad weather. A historic SpaceX launch that was set to take off today has been scrubbed due to bad weather. Liftoff of the 208ft (63 metre) tall Falcon 9 rocket was scheduled for 4:33pm EDT/2033GMT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. But poor weather conditions meant the countdown was halted at the 2 1/2-minute mark. Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, tweeted: 'Launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud.' The company will now attempt to launch the uncrewed Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, in Florida, at 4:10 pm ET tomorrow. But more bad weather is forecast. If the weather holds out, SpaceX is hoping to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform in the Atlantic Ocean. The main aim of the flight is to deliver more than 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing, equipment and science experiments to the station, which flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth. On board the Dragon capsule is an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. SpaceX is hoping to show that affordable, reusuable rockets are possible for future commercial missions. The plan is for the capsule to be released on a two-day journey to the International Space Station. Once this takes place, the rocket's first stage will flip around and fire engines to steer its descent. It will then deploy landing legs to touch down on a customised barge stationed about 200 miles (322 km) off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. At a pre-launch press conference on Sunday, SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsmann put the odds of a successful landing at 75 or 80 per cent. Nasa this morning said: 'The weather remains the primary concern for today with the most recent report calling for a 60 per cent chance of acceptable conditions at launch time.' During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. Scroll down for video . Fast-approaching storm clouds prevented the unmanned rocket from blasting off Monday from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The company will try again Tuesday. But more bad weather is forecast . The launch will be the easy part. After liftoff, SpaceX will attempt to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform in the Atlantic Ocean . Liftoff of the 208ft (63 metre) tall Falcon 9 rocket was scheduled for 4:33pm EDT/2033GMT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The company will make a second attempt on Tuesday . The ISSpresso machine uses a normal Lavazza coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. After demonstrating a successful ocean landing, SpaceX intends to bring its rockets back to a landing pad at the launch site so the boosters can be refurbished and reflown, slashing launch costs. 'It's a long-term goal,' Koenigsmann said. As well as the espresso machine, the SpaceX Dragon supply ship also holds experiments for Nasa's one-year space station resident Scott Kelly, who moved in a couple weeks ago. Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko also will remain on board until March 2016. This will be the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. A version of the coffee maker is scheduled for launch to the International Space Station aboard a supply capsule which will also include 4,000 pounds of food, science research and other equipment . Elon Musk - whose Southern California company delivers supplies to the International Space Station and aims to haul astronauts as well in two years - wants to start retrieving and reusing his rockets to save time and money. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. At Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stands ready to boost a Dragon capsule on its fifth commercial resupply mission . Saturday's mission was the group's first to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea, which was held in position using deep-sea oil rigs.

Create good habits that support you: Make sure you always have a 'reward' built in to the habit for example when you go for a run allow yourself to walk the final few blocks home, or grab a coffee. 2. Reset throughout the day: As a stress reset try and take three deep breaths feeling your belly move rather than your chest. Do this as often as possible so you're building on an accumulative practice. 3.Use your phone as a form of healthcare: Have your key values programmed into your phone to pop up each morning and let these guide your decisions. 4. Set small sustainable habits: It's the small things you do that have the biggest impact. Look at something you already do and how can you make that into a habit. For example using your commuting time effectively by listening to an audiobook. 5. Set technology boundaries: Switch off at least an hour before you go to bed at night, and don't check work emails until you're at your desk and able to deal with them. It takes attendees through a number of self-reflective activities, asking them to identify their key values and areas where they would like to improve. Four mediation sessions are spread throughout the workshops,which are filled with facts such as 80 per cent of thoughts can be negative, and 98 per cent may be the same as the previous day. 'One in six staff members now suffer from a form of mental illness, whether it be stress, anxiety, depression or suicide,' Shannah revealed. 'People don’t go and have a day off because they have the flu, they actually need a mental health day.' Through their courses they work with executives and staff from organisations such as NAB, Macquarie Bank, PwC, kikki,K, Sportsgirl, Commonwealth Bank, Hewlett Packard and Mercedes Benz to help individuals and business be the most effective they can be. Asked whether there is any resistance to something that was once seen as 'hippie' or 'new age', the women said they have not experienced any, but instead have been overwhelmed by the amount of people taking it on board. 'I've found in a lot of corporates that’s shifting a little bit, because the consequence is too expensive for them' Shannah revealed. 'When their staff blow up and their staff do get depressed and are away the cost of replacing them is too much,' she added. Through their courses the pair teach different strategies and activities that can be implemented into daily life which stop staff 'burning out'. Decades of experience: Shannah (left) has been a life coach for 15 years, while Lyndall (right) started her career in a wellness retreat . Crash and burn: Lyndall and Shannah help CEOs and executives avoid career burnouts and balance all elements of their lives . 'There’s all these different trains of thought in our mind, which train are you on?' Lyndall, who started working at a health retreat 22 years ago, said. 'Knowing that we have a choice because 80 percent of our thoughts can be negative, and 98 per cent can be the same as yesterday. 'We have 60,000-80,000 thoughts a day so that’s a lot of activity, so if you imagine you’re standing at a train station, that’s a lot of activity going on,' she continued. Practices such as meditation and even simple reminders of priorities are taught to help people stay on top of their game. Shannah knows only too well the toll a demanding career can have on one's health and wellbeing, and the implications of it crashing down around you. 'I studied coaching after having chronic fatigue after a total burnout in the corporate world,' she revealed. '(I) Studied coaching, coached athletes into retirement and then turned corporate, so I now coach CEOs, state managers, business owners and have done so for a long time, Shannah added. Creating good habits: The pair share a number of key tips which help staff take control of their lives and be the best version of themselves . Thelma and Louise: Shannah and Lyndall liken themselves to the duo from the 1991 film . Whereas Lyndall's background is 'looking after type A achievers like Shannah'. 'I grew up in a remote part of Queensland and ended up working at Camp Eden health retreat, which was two doors away from my family home. 'That cemented my passion for wellness so helping people overcome self-destructive behaviours, so alcohol addiction, drug addiction. 'But then I decided retreat experiences are fantastic but how do you integrate this back into the real world?,' Lyndall said. It was around this time that the women met in a park while out with their kids, and decided to combine their knowledge to make it accessible for a wider audience. Busy lives: As well as travelling teaching their masterclass, Lyndall (left) runs Aurora Spas and a training college, while Shannah (right) life coaches high profile athletes such as Brett Lee, but say they 'don't do stress' As well as travelling teaching their masterclass, Lyndall runs Aurora Spas and a training college, while Shannah life coaches high profile athletes such as Brett Lee, and executives such as the director of PwC, Cade Brow. 'We've got the busiest lives you've ever seen, but we don’t do stress,' Shannah said. 'It’s just having the right skill set to support yourself'. Some of the women's other high profile clients include former Olympian Benita Willis, Founder and Creative Director of kikki.K Kristina Karlsson, and media personality Deborah Hutton. They also work with executives at Macquarie Bank and NAB - who they are about to embark on a national tour with, working with staff across all levels over the coming weeks. When it comes down to it, Shannah and Lyndall say they simply help people to be the 'best version of themselves'. 'It's about putting you back as the main priority,' Lyndall said.","Shannah Kennedy and Lyndall Mitchell are 'Thelma and Louise of wellness'

10541,"The boy dubbed China's 'miracle baby' after he was born the moment his mother was killed in a horrific car crash has just celebrated his first birthday. Zhao Pingan's mother was in labour when she and her husband were hit by a truck as they travelled on a motorbike to a hospital in Xiamen city, in south-eastern China's Fujian province. Both of his parents were killed in the accident, but not before the mother gave birth at the scene last March, reports The People's Daily. Pingan Zhao (pictured) was named China's 'miracle baby' after he was born as his mother died in a crash . Chinese media reported at the time that the baby boy had been 'catapulted' from his mother's womb' as the truck ran over her, ending up ten feet away from her. This unbelievable story of his birth led to him becoming something of a local celebrity and hailed as a 'miracle baby'. The baby was given the name Zhao Pingan which means 'safe and sound' in Chinese. Pingan was then adopted by his uncle  Zhao Yanchao and his grandmother Xiao Kaixing. On Saturday, Pingan celebrated his first birthday publicly - about a month after his real birthday of March 18 - in his hometown Xiamen, surrounded by family members and the volunteers and doctors who treated him at the time. Uncle Yanchao said: 'I lost my older brother to an absolute tragedy, now I have a duty to see him live on in Pingan. Chinese media reported  that the baby boy had been 'catapulted' from his mother's womb (left) when the truck ran over her, ending up ten feet away from her. Pingan (right) celebrates his first birthday with his family . Pimgan was dubbed China's 'miracle baby' by local media after his miraculous start in life (pictured) 'He already has his eyes and his mother's smile. I shall love and treasure him as I know they would have done.' To celebrate his birthday his aunt, Ms Zhang, in keeping with Pingan's native Sichuan tradition, gave some items for the little boy to 'hold on to' to determine his future. He immediately took a calculator, pen and an apple. 'These three items indicates Pingan will safely proceed with his studies and he will have a deep interest in learning.' said a smiling Ms Zhang. When Pingan was seven months old he was taken Beijing's Tiantan Hospital Neurosurgery department to have an operation to drain the build-up of water in his head. A doctor said because of Pingan's injuries his development may be a bit behind his peers, especially in his speech and ability to walk. Pingan enjoys a piece of cake as he celebrates his first birthday one year on from the horror crash . But despite his difficult start in life Pingan has developed into a happy and smiling little boy. Now Pingan's uncle and aunty are preparing to move and work away from home in order to bring in more money as they are concerned about the ongoing treatment he will need. 'Pingan may still need further operations,' said his uncle Zhao Yanchao. Baby Pingan suffered from minor bruises and scratches when he was found at the scene of the accident last year. Police spokesman Chan Chien said at the time: 'Eye witnesses said that when the woman was hit by the truck she gave birth on the spot. ' Pingan is a happy little boy - but his family are concerned he could require further hospital treatment for the injuries he received in the crash . 'Others said that the baby which was a healthy 4.2 kg had been thrown out of the woman's belly and had landed three meters away.' Police confirmed soon after the accident that they had arrested a 45-year-old truck driver who had apparently turned into the road just as the motorbike was coming along. A spokesman from Beiiing Tian Tan Hospital said shortly after the accident: 'The baby has had an MRI scan because he is suffering from hydrocephalus, water on the brain, which was caused by the accident. 'He will need to undergo more surgery although we do not think his condition is serious. 'He truly is a miracle baby.' Xiamen City Hospital Paediatrician Dr Fang Mei, who treated Pingan at the time, said on Saturday: 'When he first arrived he was covered in dirt with cuts to his head.' 'Weighing over 9lb the baby boy still had his umbilical cord and placenta attached to him when he arrived at the hospital.' Dr Fang said that as Pingan had hit the floor quite hard he had sustained some nerve damage to his fragile body. She said: 'None of the medical staff had seen how Pingan was pushed out of his mother's body and we wonder how it could have been possible - but the fact that he survived is something of a miracle.' Pingan's plight moved the nation and volunteers and charities flocked to offer their time and help with his recovery. Two branches of the Red Cross in Xiamen City set up a '3.18 Hai Cang Miracle Baby Fund' and were able to find 50 'Loving Mummies' to provide him with round the clock care and attention. The head of a local charity volunteer group, Ms Li, said they set up a call to action movement to help the miracle baby and were 'overwhelmed' by the response. Nappies, toys, as well as expertise and time were all donated to Pingan. The baby poses with some of the hospital staff and volunteers who helped care for him following the crash .

6337,"Two trainee obstetricians have been removed from a newly developed $2 million hospital in Western Australia reportedly over  concerns about the quality of service and problems with patient safety at the obstetric unit. The concerns around Fiona Stanley Hospital, in southwest Perth, were revealed to theWest Australian by unnamed sources. However, according to health authorities, the move was purely based on reshuffling junior medical faculty. The latest potential developments at the hospital follow recent reports  that blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments . The West Australian was told junior doctors were moved to 'maximise training opportunities' by a state committee that organises both accreditation and training for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The hospital went on 'baby bypass' when the maternity unit opened four months ago, due to an unexpectedly high number of women giving birth. The hospital consequently had to direct expectant mothers to other hospitals. This week the RANZCOG told the West Australian that the obstetrics unit, which opened on December 2 last year, was approved for  training in March. Michael Gannon, president of the Australian Medical Association WA, told the West Australian he knew of issues surrounding the recently opened obstetrics unit. He said concerns of the unit's services were similar to others at the hospital, due to planning issues from years ago. The hospital was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February . Earlier in the week, it was revealed that the hospital's medical service provider Serco failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February. The company was fined $60,000 and was subject to Department of Health workers auditing its staff, but the hospital was reportedly operating with poorly sanitised instruments, reported the ABC. Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon noted recent reports that some instruments contained blood and human matter. 'There's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment, there's been reports, that are really hard to believe, of blood still being seen on some instruments,' he said. 'So this gives us great concern.'. Dr Gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospital's public image and likely cause a loss of morale within its workforce. 'I can't imagine how people must feel if they've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage,' he said.","Two trainee obstetricians have reportedly been removed from a newly-opened $2 million hospital in Western Australia .

11286,"A handful of peanuts a day may help prevent food poisoning, a study has found. Eating the kernels without their skins can improve gut health and the ability to ward off bugs like E.coli, according to the research. Scientists from the University of Maryland found that flour made from peanut kernel significantly stimulated the growth of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, the type of friendly bacteria more commonly associated with yoghurt drinks. Eating peanut kernels without their skins can improve gut health and the ability to ward off bugs like E.coli, according to research by the University of Maryland . By increasing the amount of good bacteria, the peanut flour was able to reduce the amount of a dangerous bacterium, Enterohaemorrhagic E.coli, which can cause severe food poisoning. The friendly bacteria out-competes the harmful bacteria by occupying space on intestinal walls and by producing antimicrobial substances. Four made from peanut kernel stimulates the growth of friendly bacteria, research has found . Lead researcher Dr Debabrata Biswas said: ‘Eating approximately 50g of peanut kernels a day could improve the gut microflora and would help to protect against foodborne illnesses caused by common foodborne bacterial pathogens.’ When the scientists tested the peanut skin, however, they found it had the opposite effect to the peanut kernel, inhibiting the growth of good bacteria and promoting the growth of the harmful E.coli and Salmonella bacteria. Writing in the Journal of Food Science, the researchers concluded: ‘These results suggest that peanut kernels, by improving the beneficial effect of lactobacillus, might reduce the risk of foodborne pathogens infection in the gut. ‘However, the role of peanut skin in human health remains to be further investigated.’ E.coli can be transmitted by eating undercooked meat such as mince, or contaminated vegetables that haven’t been washed properly. Salmonella is found in the gut of many animals, especially poultry. Proper cooking usually destroys it. Undercooked eggs can also be a source.","Flour made from peanut kernel majorly stimulated growth of friendly bacteria .

2604,"(CNN)When Etan Patz went missing in New York City at age 6, hardly anyone in America could help but see his face at their breakfast table. His photo's appearance on milk cartons after his May 1979 disappearance marked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children. On Friday, more than 35 years after frenzied media coverage of his case horrified parents everywhere, a New York jury will again deliberate over a possible verdict against the man charged in his killing, Pedro Hernandez. He confessed to police three years ago. Etan Patz's parents have waited that long for justice, but some have questioned whether that is at all possible in Hernandez's case. His lawyer has said that he is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to discern whether he committed the crime or not. Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in Lower Manhattan. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag. Neither the child nor his remains have ever been recovered. But Hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an ""IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,"" his attorney Harvey Fishbein has said. Police interrogated Hernandez for 7½ hours before he confessed. ""I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn't mean he actually did, and that's the whole point of this case,"" Fishbein has said. But in November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez's confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights were legal, making the confession admissible in court. Another man's name has also hung over the Patz case for years -- Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Etan's parents, Stan and Julia Patz, sued Ramos in 2001. The boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million -- money the Patz family has never received. Though Ramos was at the center of investigations for years, he has never been charged. He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012. He was reportedly immediately rearrested upon exiting jail in 2012 on failure to register as a sex offender. Since their young son's disappearance, the Patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the United States. In the early 1980s, Etan's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children. ""It awakened America,"" said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. ""It was the beginning of a missing children's movement."" The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said. But the news industry was expanding to cable television, and sweet images of children appeared along with destroyed parents begging for their safe return. The fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Former President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls. Joe Sterling and CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","The young boy's face appeared on milk cartons all across the United States .

But McCall is adamant that confidence will not be dented by the scale of the loss and he expects his players to bounce back in Sunday’s home meeting with Raith Rovers. Stuart McCall  urged Rangers to show an immediate response to the first defeat of his tenure . The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston . ‘We’ve already spoken about going into the play-offs with good momentum,’ said McCall. ‘Tonight is a set-back but we’ve got to make sure on Sunday that we don’t have another set-back or then it can become a problem. ‘We will be fully focused on Sunday and we will be looking for the three points. ‘There will be no confidence factor come Sunday — I can assure you of that. Sometimes you get beat and you just have to hold your hands up and give credit to the opposition. ‘I was pleased with certain things leading up to their first goal. I thought we were doing well. ‘I said to the lads that we will put a line under it. Yeah, we know we weren’t good tonight but we will be good on Sunday.’ Rangers remain third in the table — behind Hibernian on goal difference but with a game in hand — after what was their biggest-ever loss to Queens. ‘Fair play to them,’ said McCall, who expects Cammy Bell to be fit to face Raith after a minor knee injury. ‘They were clinical when they had their chances. New manager McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park . Lewis Kidd celebrates after doubling Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half . ‘We controlled large parts of the first half but they got a lot of good blocks in. It’s about scoring goals and they got the first one. ‘Then we lost a goal that was really poor defending straight from the kick-off. Then you are chasing the game and that suited them with their pace on the counter attack. ‘We had some chances in the second half but we never really did enough. We weren’t good enough to win the game but we move on. ‘I’ve said it before and I will say it again, there will be ups and downs between now and the end of the season. It’s how we react to it, and Sunday can’ t come quickly enough for me.’ Jubilant Queen of the South boss James Fowler was thrilled with a result that saw his team leapfrog Falkirk into that crucial fourth place in the Championship standings. ‘We were backs to the wall a wee bit in the first half,’ admitted Fowler. ‘But we managed to cope with that. We got the goal and then getting another one so early in the second half was great. ‘All the players were great and we are pushing hard.’","Rangers lost 3-0 against Queen of the South on Thursday night .

3340,"A former member, Miracle, told Daily Mail Australia abuse victims were often blamed for their situations . As police step up their inquiries into a secretive Christian community following abuse allegations, former members have told of a culture of victim-blaming. Gloriavale, a New Zealand settlement of around 500 where everyone follows a strict New Testament creed and wears blue uniforms, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks. Several ex-members have come forward, telling stories of sexual abuse, violence and bullying - sometimes involving underage girls. Miracle escaped Gloriavale with her family around six years ago. She told Daily Mail Australia that sex outside of marriage and with underage children was 'absolutely frowned upon' and 'dealt with very severely in the community'. 'In saying that, these things have happened. These allegations against certain individuals - there is truth in them. 'Where it's been brought out into the open, the leaders have dealt with it - but where I disagree is that the girls in particular are blamed. Scroll down for video . Gloriavale, a New Zealand settlement of around 500 where everyone follows a strict New Testament creed and wears blue uniforms, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks following abuse allegations . Residents of Gloriavale follow a New Testament code, wear blue uniforms and do not use birth control. This still is from a previous documentary about Gloriavale . Gloriavale is located on the west coast of New Zealand and has an estimated population of around 500 . 'Julia', pictured, told a New Zealand television program she was the victim of a 'wrong relationship' with an adult man when she was a child . 'They have been called w****s and s***s and that sort of thing and almost exonerated the guys. The guys couldn't help it. 'That then causes an effect where the girls don't want to bring it out into the open. They think if I go and say, ""this happened to me"" they'll turn on me and ""blame me"".' Miracle said there had been a few 'one off incidents' - but that 'it's not just the one'. 'Where I disagree is the way it's been dealt with, it's always placed on the girl. 'Women are treated well, they are looked after very well, but there is this doctrine that women submit to the men and do what they are told. '(The men) are brought before meetings and dealt with. They are punished. But not to the same extent the girl would be.' Another former member, Karen Winder, told stuff.co.nz abuse was 'not rampant'. She said young men are 'groomed' to have sex with underage girls and should not shoulder the blame. '(Some think) that 13 and 14 year old girls are ready to have babies - there's no child rape going on,' Ms Winder was quoted saying. 'A 23-year-old is not necessarily culpable for his actions, because he's been groomed for it.' She reportedly added that she knew of a female member who had been involved with an older man when she was 15. There has been an exodus from Gloriavale (located on the picturesque banks of Lake Haupiri) in recent years . Another escapee, Julia, told the Campbell Live program earlier this month that she had a 'wrong relationship with a married guy when she was 12 or 13' - and he was a decade older. Gloriavale responded to recent allegations in an interview with TVNZ this week. 'There have been serious allegations but it doesn't mean they're all true,' said a spokesman. He would not discuss the particulars. Police reportedly made a 'social call' to the town this week and are urging anyone with evidence of abuse to come forward. Miracle said Gloriavale needs to open itself up the outside world. 'These things are starting to happen more and more frequently because of their closing off,' she said. There has been a mass exodus from Gloriavale over the past two years, most recently including a family of 14 in March. They, and other families are now living  some 350km south-west of Gloriavale.

Brisbane locals were left scratching their heads after the mysterious message 'I'm sorry' followed by a love heart and two crosses for kisses was splashed across the city's clear blue sky on Monday afternoon. The aerial apology hovered above the CBD at about 1pm, prompting several people to jump onto social media to question and voice their theories about who had done what. One desperate man has forked out nearly $4000 for a written message in the sky in a bid to seek forgiveness . The aerial apology was followed by a love heart and two crosses for kisses on Monday afternoon . Jordan Miller tweeted on Twitter: 'I'm not sure what he did but that's a big apology!! Lucky he screwed up on a clear day! What if it were overcast?' He followed with another tweet: 'Men of Brisbane. If you've screwed up in the last 24 hrs have your partner look at the sky right now. You're welcome.' ABC reporter Kathy McLeish posted: 'Giant sky-writing apology over Brisbane CBD... Must have been bad..' While the author and recipient remain a mystery, the creation behind the message was Rob Vance, of Skywriting Services Australia, who took just 10 minutes to complete the urgent appeal. 'I'm not sure what he did but that's a big apology!! Lucky he screwed up on a clear day! What if it were overcast?' Jordan Miller tweeted . Locals quickly took to Twitter to question who the mysterious message was directed at . People have jumped to conclusion, believing the man must have done something terribly bad . An ABC reporter also took to Twitter, considering the apology was trying to make up for something bad . But the man who requested it didn't appear to be frantically lovelorn, he said.

7216,"It is eight long, barren years since an English club claimed the top prize in European rugby and the bookmakers aren't convinced the grim cycle can be broken this year. When Wasps claimed the Heineken Cup in 2007 with victory over Leicester, it seemed unthinkable that the Premiership would not produce another continental champion for so long. Yet since then Irish teams have seized four titles — Leinster claiming a hat-trick — and French teams three, accurately reflecting the balance of power in the European game. This season is not seen as any real exception, despite the presence of four English sides in the last eight of the new Champions Cup. There is a consensus among the bookies that holders Toulon are destined to finish on top of the pile for the third successive year, with Clermont their primary challengers followed by Racing and Leinster. The Aviva Premiership quartet are all away from home this weekend and are all firm underdogs. Francois Louw runs with the ball during the Bath Rugby training session held at Farleigh House . Bath's George Ford practices his kicking during the training session at the Farleigh House complex . Leinster's Jamie Heaslip is tackled by Sailosi Tagicakibau during the Champions Cup match with Wasps . In World Cup year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on May 2 but there are significant reasons why an English triumph shouldn't happen. The first comes down to money. Northampton, Saracens, Bath and Wasps are well-funded, with strong squads, but their resources are modest compared to French powerhouses Toulon, Clermont and Racing, who have budgets three or four times the size of their Premiership opponents. Across the Channel, squads are awash with Test-class players from around the world, even on the bench. Meanwhile, Leinster have superb recent European pedigree and benefit from the Irish system which sees top players rested from league duties in order to peak on these major occasions.Bath will find themselves in hostile territory at the Aviva Stadium, but they went to Toulouse in January and scorched the earth to win 35-18. If their pack can go toe-to-toe with the hosts, the likes of Jonathan Joseph are capable of wreaking havoc. Make no mistake, Mike Ford's team are capable of winning in Dublin. Also on Saturday, Northampton face an arduous task in trying to storm the Stade Marcel Michelin fortress where Clermont are on a 22-match unbeaten run in Europe. The Saints are the only English team to win an away quarter-final against French opposition — beating Biarritz 7-6 in 2007. English sides have lost the eight other quarter-finals they have played across the Channel.

Clermont winger Napolioni Nalaga (right) charges with the ball during the match against Bordeaux-Begles . Nothampton's Stephen Myler (left) and Luther Burrell (right) prepare to tackle Jamie Roberts of Racing Metro . The current Premiership champions were losing Heineken Cup finalists in 2011. To reach that stage again would require a monumental result this weekend, but Clermont are far from infallible, as Saracens proved, thrashing them 46-6 in last season's epic semi-final. The London club lost to Toulon in the final, but they have been the standard-bearers for English rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to Paris and beat Racing, who can be wildly inconsistent. Wasps captain James Haskell provides a link back to the club's distant 2007 success, but Dai Young's men will be confronting a multi-national force in Toulon that would beat most Test teams. If they were to stun the holders, it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in European competition. There is a fair chance that one English team can progress, with Bath and Saracens the more likely candidates. If two were to make it, that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale. Wasps captain James Haskell receives a pass during the training session at Twyford Avenue Sports Ground .","It has been eight years since an English club triumphed in the European Champions Cup .
Despite four English teams in this year's quarter-finals, that hoodoo looks set to persist .
English clubs are nowhere near as well-resourced as French clubs .

1710,"It's that time of year again - the in between seasons moment when you look in your wardrobe and genuinely believe there is nothing suitable for the weather outside. In the springtime, the shops are full of new season clothes that are just waiting for a sunny day but still unsuitable for the ever-changing British weather. Cotton dresses, cut-off mini skirts and denim hot pants all need to wait until at least June for an appearance. Scroll down for video . Lily Melrose is a fashion blogger who has 137,000 followers on Instagram . So what to do if you want to embrace summer style now, but keep away from the shops for another couple of months? Fortunately, there are still plenty of crafty ways to keep your wardrobe current - and all you need is a pair of pliers, a glue gun and some scissors. UK stylist and blogger Lily Melrose has come up with 15 style hacks to transform your 2014 wardrobe into 2015 style, without breaking the bank. Read on to find out the DIY tips for making your clothes up to date... Lily models her updated dress, complete with necklace collar . Evening glam . Perfect for a night out with the girls, give your trusty little black dress a gorgeous splash of glam that captures this season’s catwalk style by using an old necklace to create a stunning jewelled collar effect. Use pliers to separate the necklace into individual jewels, position the pieces around the collar and simply use a glue gun to attach, instantly adding ‘the glam factor’ as seen on Matthew Williamson and House of Holland collections this Spring. Off-duty pastels . Dip-dye is big news this season and a subtle dip-dye effect will add a burst of spring colour to any daytime look. Hand dye and a bowl is all that is needed to update last year’s festival staple, the white vest. Carefully dip the first few inches of the vest into your favourite pastel shade and leave to dry. Lily’s top pick is on-trend blush pink and styled with jeans and a leather jacket for a casual daytime look. Lily shows you how to update sunglasses . DIY designer shades . As the sun comes out, it’s time to dust off last year’s sunglasses. For an effortless, high-impact update, take some jewels or artificial flowers and carefully glue these to the brim or sides of the sunglasses in a symmetrical design. Already a  trend seen on the faces of Dolce & Gabbana and Prada catwalk models this season, this simple and cost-effective design will ensure you’re one step ahead of the fashion set . Dare to bare (your knees) You don’t need to buy a new pair of jeans to sport this season’s biggest denim trend – plus worn jeans are softer too so they’re much easier to customise. Cut a rip just above the knee cap and then pull out threads and distress the edges for the perfect laid-back cool look. Team with patterned tights underneath for a fresh take on this look. Hair jewelry . The Les Copains label was among those adorning catwalk hairstyles with statement jewellery, but you don’t need to buy them. Carefully attach old necklace jewels (broken down by pliers) onto hairgrips with glue and leave to dry, to turn a boring hair day into a cute one. Headphone sparkle . In fact, embellishment can be used to spruce up any accessory – take inspiration from Dolce & Gabbana’s bejewelled headphones and add some sparkle to your commute by adding old jewels and diamantes to the outside of your Beats headphones. Fringed boots is a key look for 2015 . Seventies chic . The Seventies look has exploded on to the high street from the catwalks, but instead of going all in with flared jeans and heavy prints, try wearing existing key items in a new way. Channel the vibe with a high waisted skirt (bonus points if it’s the classic Seventies shade of camel), teamed with a tucked in black polo neck. For extra fashion points, cut off the sleeves of the polo neck as seen in Topshop this season for an easy update for spring. Crystal slippers . Take last year’s slipper shoe and update for this season by attaching some studs to them for an edgy spring look. The soft fabric makes it easy to attach them; pierce the fabric with each stud and fold them flat on the inside using pliers to keep them secure and comfortable. Cropped logo T-shirts: Nineties style has been in for a while now, but this year expect to see classic logo T-shirts updated for spring with cut off sleeves and cropped to the waist a la Daisy Lowe. No sewing needed – just don’t be afraid to take your scissors to your favourite old T-shirt! Fringe feet: Fringing has been big for a few seasons now, but this season the must-have is going to be fringing on your feet; take a simple suede tassel in the same shade as your favourite boots and attach using a few stitches. Use thread in the same shade for a seamless look. Faux fur gilet . Spring is the hardest time to style as the weather is so changeable; dig out last year’s faux fur cropped jacket from your wardrobe and unpick the sleeves to create a gilet to throw on over T-shirts for warm, breezy days. Rita Ora was wearing a faux fur gilet in New York in February . Instagram . Pinterest and instagram are the perfect ‘virtual wardrobe’; when you get compliments on outfits or try something new, take a snap and post them to create your own style bible that you can refer to at any time. Just by looking through you’ll probably see something you haven’t worn in a while that’s worth digging out! Colour pop . The classic white shirt is a style staple, but you can add a bit of spring colour simply by swapping the buttons for bright alternatives. Just a few hand sewn stitches can change the entire look with subtle hints of colour. Personalised pumps . With even Prada getting in on the act, personalised footwear is everywhere right now. But you can create your own one-of-a kind look by using a paintbrush to paint fabric dye onto the panels of your favourite Converse or plimsolls. Celebrity dye job . One way to revive hair for the new season is with an ombre style. Rather than transforming your locks with an all-new shade, why not choose pink tips. The flash of colour will refresh locks for spring. Lily Melrose supplied her style hacks in association with Gallo Family Vineyards Moscato.

6357,"Andy Lee will leave New York with his head held high and a burgeoning reputation firmly intact. A dramatic, frenetic 12 rounds here saw the Irishman sent sprawling in the very first against the dangerous Peter Quillin, the man who vacated the WBO middleweight title Lee won so gloriously in Las Vegas last December before the result was deemed a draw. It was the first time the reigning champion had gone the distance. No mean feat considering he fought for a lengthy period with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm. Peter Quillin (left) and Andy Lee stand with the referee after the judges declared their bout a draw . The two fighters embrace following their exciting 12-round contest in Brooklyn on Saturday night . Lee retains his WBO belt after Quillin failed to make the required 160lbs weight on Friday . Quillin's unbeaten record remains intact following the tie though he threw fewer punches than Lee . The two fighters congratulate each other at the end of the 12 rounds, which were judged to be a draw . With Quillin dramatically failing to make the required weight of 160lbs on Friday, Lee strode out in front of a healthy crowd knowing whatever happens, his belt wasn't going anywhere. Yet this was still one hell of a contest and when the judges correctly called it a tie, no-one was really arguing. While it was scored 113-112, 112-113, 113-113, the statistics told a different story . Lee threw more punches (299-267) and connected with greater frequency (113-103). It was a warrior-like display. Not maybe enough to have destroyed Quillin's unbeaten record, but impressively solid and energetic. Lee, however, was hard on himself. 'It was a tough fight, he dropped me at the start because I was lazy, ' he said. 'I had the momentum late on. I understand with two knockdowns people may have thought he won but I could have done better.' Billy Joe Saunders is the mandatory challenger and looks the likeliest next opponent. Another meeting with Quillin, although intriguing with the title on the line, is highly unlikely. Lee was knocked to the canvas by Quillin during the very first round of the contest in New York . Lee admitted he had been 'lazy' in the early stages of the fight, leading to his knockdown and standing count . Quillin is ordered to the corner after Lee falls later in the bout . 'If my next fight is Quillin it should be in Ireland. He has an Irish surname. Maybe he has some ancestors there,' smiled Lee, who will now look forward to a few weeks off to recharge the batteries before making his next move. Only the American will know how, even though he last fought a year ago, his team somehow allowed their man to miss the weight so spectacularly. The 31-year-old was over by almost a pound-and-a-half. Trainer Adam Booth thought he looked over the limit in the build-up. Lee would never display such a lack of professionalism. The 30-year-old in the form and shape of his life. Title fight or not, this was the Irishman's chance to show he belongs at boxing's top table. A polished display was the order of the evening to ensure his rapier-like trajectory continues this year. Quillin insisted before the clash it would be like a chess match. He was right, yet playing with Kings or Queens don't often lead to the explosion of power which sent Lee spiralling to the canvas at the end of the first round. Quillin's right connects with Lee's right shoulder during the Middleweight bout . Lee and Quillin exchange punches at close quarters during the tight contest . Lee is put onto the pack foot as Quillin lines up a punch with his right . Quillin's right hook rocked the Irishman who was given a standing count. It was just the second time he'd hit the floor, taking in both his amateur and professional career. No wonder Lee looked dazed. The American was quickly showing why he's the proud owner of an unblemished record. A razor-sharp combination had Lee reeling again but the Limerick man is a true warrior. A far better third saw Quillin on the backfoot for the first time as, after such a frenetic start, everything began to calm somewhat. Lee went down again and although it was originally scored as a knockdown it later emerged Quillin had stepped on his foot. If the scorecard had taken that into account, a draw could well have turned into an Irish win. Nevertheless, Lee needed some respite. The Brooklyn crowd unleashed some booing to display their displeasure at both fighters standing their ground. Yet the Irishman, who won his last two fights by coming from behind to land the killer blow, wouldn't have care a jot. Heading into the sixth, Quillin was ahead in the eyes of the judges. Lee, the master of coming from behind to snatch victory, needed something special. Quillin connects with Lee's cheek with a crunching right . Quillin again makes contact but over the course of the whole fight, he landed fewer punches . The comeback came at the end of the seventh, a crunching right leaving a very open Quillin tumbling. It was the first time he'd been down in his career. Lee, though, needed more heading into the tenth. The final rounds were dramatic without ever really looking terminal for either fighter. And when the last bell rang, Lee and the amiable Quillin hugged and showed a deep admiration towards each other which has been evident all week. 'The judges see it their way and I respect the decision, ' said the American. 'There is a first time for everything, I got knocked down and thankfully I got up. There is no perfect story, I come from nothing so to have something is a blessing as is going home to a family I love. 'Respect to Andy Lee though.'","Judges scored the contest 113-112, 112-113, 113-113 - a tie .

9871,"Nigel Farage caused controversy at the televised leaders’ debate by attacking the high cost of giving anti-retroviral drugs to sufferers not born in Britain . Half of voters agree with Ukip that immigrants should not immediately receive free HIV treatment, a poll suggests. Nigel Farage caused controversy at the televised leaders’ debate last week by attacking the high cost of giving anti-retroviral drugs to sufferers not born in Britain. Ed Miliband said his comments were ‘disgusting’, Nick Clegg said they were ‘politics of the lowest form’ and chancellor George Osborne, when asked, said he was ‘not going to dignify that with a response.’ The Ukip leader insisted afterwards that he had the ‘overwhelming support’ of the British public for saying that foreign nationals with HIV – whom he said accounted for 60 per cent of the 7,000 cases a year – ‘can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per patient’. He added: ‘I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.’ A YouGov poll of 1,906 adults found that 50 per cent would support ‘people coming to live in the UK being banned from receiving treatment on the NHS for a period of five years’. Another 34 per cent opposed such a ban. A second question saw voters asked which statement best reflected their view. In this, 52 per cent thought Mr Farage was ‘right to raise this issue - immigrants with serious conditions like HIV are costing the health service a large amount of money’. This compared with 37 per cent who picked: ‘Nigel Farage was just scaremongering - compared to the total cost of the NHS this is a drop in the ocean’, and 11 per cent did not know. Interestingly, the respondents did not appear to particularly favour Ukip, saying on average that Mr Farage was only the fourth best-performing leader last Thursday, with Nicola Sturgeon in the lead, followed by David Cameron and Ed Miliband. It later emerged that Mr Farage’s figures were a bit out – there are 6,000 diagnoses of HIV every year according to Public Health England. Diane James, an MEP and the party’s justice and home affairs spokesman, insisted yesterday that Ukip would go on if Farage lost . Just over half (54 per cent) are foreign born, but most of them are thought to have been infected whilst living in the UK. The cost of anti-retroviral drugs per year gas been put at up to £16,000 depending on the stage of infection. The Ukip leader, speaking on the campaign trail yesterday defended his remarks saying he wanted people to ‘think and understand why their grandmother who is 85 finds it very difficult to get drugs for breast cancer but anybody can get on a plane from anywhere in the world, be HIV tested in London and receive antiretroviral drugs. Something, it seems to me, isn’t right here.’ Any foreign national - even a failed asylum seeker – who is diagnosed, has been entitled to free treatment since 2012 due to what experts say are the risks of allowing the virus to spread. A Ukip spokesman said: ‘This poll finding shows yet again the disconnect that exists between the Westminster bubble and much of the population. 'Nigel Farage is the one leader who has the political courage to raise difficult issues and clearly millions of voters agree with that stance.’ It later emerged that Mr Farage’s figures were a bit out – there are 6,000 diagnoses of HIV every year according to Public Health England . Mr Farage took a blow yesterday as another poll showed he would fail to secure a Parliamentary seat. He has vowed to stand down as leader if he fails to become the MP for Thanet South, which he is fighting hard to win at the General Election. A private ComRes poll paid for by a Ukip donor put the Conservatives on course to retain the seat by a small margin. But Diane James, an MEP and the party’s justice and home affairs spokesman, insisted yesterday that Ukip would go on if he lost, and that future leaders of the Eurosceptic party were waiting to ‘put their hats in the ring’. Patrick O’Flynn, Ukip’s economics spokesman, said in an interview on Sky News yesterday that Ukip were not seeking to withdraw treatment from HIV positive foreign nationals already receiving drugs from the NHS.","Nigel Farage caused controversy at the televised leaders' debate last week .

Poppy Moore, 23, wed her childhood sweetheart Sam Myers at Chelsea Register Office with only 12 loved ones before hosting a reception for 50 at the Mayfair Hotel.

Poppy Moore married Sam Myers at Chelsea Register Office yesterday . Sam Myers with bride Poppy, her mum Sara and grandmother Tina Moore at Chelsea Register Office . She wore her hair in a half up-do, with a Sixties-style beehive - perhaps in reference to her grandfather's heyday. Her chic dress had white flower detail embroidered on the bodice, while layers of tulle gave the skirt extra volume. Among the guests were Poppy's mother Sara and her grandmother Tina, Bobby's first wife. Poppy was only 18 months old when her famous grandfather died in February, 1993. The England and West Ham legend who captained the 1966's World Cup winning side was only 51 when he lost his battle with bowel cancer. She and Bobby's two other grandchildren Freddie and Ava marked the 20th anniversary of his death in 2013 by placing the ball on the spot for a West Hame home game, the club he captained for ten years. Poppy Moore poses with her new husband Sam Myers and mum Sara . Poppy is also involved with the Moore Family Fund to fight bowel cancer. Her mother Sara told The Mirror: 'Bobby would’ve been very proud of his granddaughter and very happy. She is a beautiful young lady and a credit to us all. 'It was a very special day, it was lovely. Her father Dean would have been so proud of her, too. It’s such a shame that he couldn’t be with us.' The Moore family experienced tragedy when Poppy's father Dean died young. Poppy, who was just 19 at the time, paid an emotional tribute to 'the best man in my life'. Bobby, who would have been 74 yesterday, met his first wife Tina in 1957 and the pair, who lived in Chigwell, Essex, had two children Dean and daughter Roberta.

8630,"Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for.

There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'","Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather meet in Las Vegas on May 2 in 'The Fight of the Century'

75,"A robot has been 'arrested' by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the 'dark net'. The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen, in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web (pictured) including trainers, jeans, cigarettes, a set of masterkeys and a DVD case (far left) containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class-A drug MDMA, which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, along with the other items it bought. They described the police's actions as an 'unjustified intervention into the freedom of art'. Writing on their blog, London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo, who were behind the project, said: 'Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. 'At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. 'In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. 'The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts, even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. 'We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot, for us and for freedom of art!' The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets, pictured above, were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography, drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However, the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself, they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet. In the past the artists have used technology to intercept CCTV images and sent a package to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Mr Smoljo and Miss Weisskopf said: 'The Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there.'","Random Darknet Shopper is a computer bot that randomly purchases an item every week from a hidden part of the internet called the dark net .

1919,"Kate Winslet faces a planning battle with Natural England over plans to build sea defences . Kate Winslet is to face a battle with Natural England over plans to build a 550ft-long wall to protect her £3.25 million beachside home from flooding and erosion. The multi BAFTA-winning actress, 39, wants to install a boulder and gravel seawall along the West Sussex coast to protect her property. But Natural England has recommended the planning application be refused - citing concerns  it may result in the 'direct loss' of natural habitat designated for rare and vulnerable birds, trees and wetlands. The Academy Award-winning actress bought the eight bedroom house in West Sussex in 2013. She lives there with her husband, Richard Branson's nephew Ned Rocknroll, and her three children. But the environmental body has recommended her local District Council reject the application because of concerns over the impact it will have on the natural habitat. It is also unclear what effect the sea wall would have on a public footpath that runs along the bottom of the estate by the seashore. The shoreline is currently unprotected. The actress' Grade II-listed home backs onto a site that is a designated special protection area to safeguard wildlife living along the coast. Wildlife  include waders, geese, ducks, herons, terns and cormorants. It is also in a 'Ramsar site', according to Natural England - which are protected under Government policy as 'proposed or listed wetlands of international importance.' The application is one of a number of requests previously submitted to the council for extensive renovation work at the house including the building of an underground swimming pool, garage and pool house. The planning document states: 'The proposed privately funded sea defences will ensure that the existing vegetation and public footpath will be protected into the future. 'Furthermore it should be considered that the footpath is liable to become dangerous in areas without protection from further erosion of the existing banks.' A spokesman for Natural England said: 'Our objection centres on the fact that the application site falls within land which is protected as a Special Area of Conservation, Special Protection Area, Ramsar and Site of Special Scientific Interest. 'The proposal would result in direct loss of protected habitat and would be likely to have a significant, adverse effect on these designated sites. Winslet wants to build a sea wall along the West Sussex coast to protect her £3.25million beach house . Plans submitted to her local District Council show the proposed sea wall to protect Winslet's property . 'The application did not include any information to address the likely impacts and no mitigation was proposed. 'We will continue to liaise with the applicant about alternatives which would avoid loss of designated habitat.' A local conservation body has also submitted comments on the application and said it is concerned about the impact of a sea wall on the appearance of the area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB). Concerns have also been raised about potential erosion of a coastal path that could be caused by the defence . In a letter it said: 'We remain unconvinced of the need for this sea defence, and that its impacts on the landscape and nature conservation interests of the AONB would be acceptable.' The Conservancy has also recommended the application be refused. This is not the first time the actress has come across problems with planning applications. Winslet previously owned a £2 million home in Treyford, near Chichester. But she sold the 15th century property in 2014 following another planning spat with locals after she proposed to install gates at the entrance. The council has set aside more time for the planning application to be explored further. No date has been set for a decision.","Kate Winslet submitted application for a sea wall along West Sussex coast .

6045,"(CNN)When Bruce Jenner told ABC's Diane Sawyer and the world on Friday night that ""Yes, for all intents and purposes, I'm a woman,"" the declaration wasn't particularly surprising. Paparazzi have been stalking the former Olympic champion for months, breathlessly documenting his increasingly feminine appearance down to his lip gloss, pierced ears and French manicure. The social media reaction?  A cheer, a shrug -- and not much else. Except the occasional prod at Jenner also being Republican. Of course, Jenner's family owned the moment, being the reality TV mavens they are -- the Jenners and the Kardashians. ""So very proud of you, my hero,"" tweeted daughter Kendall Jenner. His other daughter Kylie Jenner expressed mixed emotions. ""Understandingly, this has been very hard for me. You will hear what I have to say when I'm ready to but ... this isn't about me. I'm so proud of you, Dad. You are so brave. My beautiful Hero,"" she said on Twitter. Ex-wife Kris Jenner was equally supportive. ""Not only was I able to call him my husband for 25 years and father of my children, I am now able to call him my hero,"" she said. Stepdaughters Kim, Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian also joined the family chorus. ""Love is the courage to live the truest, best version of yourself. Bruce is love. I love you Bruce. #ProudDaughter,"" Kim tweeted. ""Just finished watching the #BruceJennerInterview with the family. Bruzer, I'm soooo proud of you! Dads really are heros ❤️,"" Khloé said on Twitter. ""Couldn't be a more proud daughter. With courage and bravery, let's change the world. I am honored to stand by Bruce's side and support him,"" Kourtney said. The entertainment industry was quick to embrace the news. Lady Gaga has long supported lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. ""We have the chance to write this moment in history together,"" she tweeted.  ""Let's empower people like Bruce all over the world by being loving & not mean.💗"" Transgender actress Laverne Cox of ""Orange is the New Black"" gave a shout out. ""Sending lots of love and support to #BruceJenner and their family tonight,"" she tweeted.  ""It is always brave to stand in one's truth. Congrats darling."" The Jenner interview was a key moment for advocacy groups like GLAAD and  the National Center for Transgender Equality, thrusting LGBT issues into the spotlight. ""Today, millions of people learned that someone they know is transgender,"" GLAAD tweeted. ""Welcome, #BruceJenner,"" Trans Equality tweeted.  ""Thank you for your courage and bravery."" As with all things, public opinion is hardly unanimous and social media only represents the views of those who post. Still, there were few detractors. One man used an Old Testament Bible verse as the basis for his stance. ""GOP Logic: Bruce Jenner is not Gay...but Transgender,"" Benny said on Twitter.  ""Still forbidden by the Bible but we cherrypick."" This woman wasn't sure what to make of Jenner's announcement. ""Still confused about Bruce Jenner becoming a woman...,"" tweeted HugHey. And what would a social media event be without a good dose of humor. Many folks seemed to be more intrigued by Jenner's announcement that he's Republican than him coming out as a woman. ""I accept that Bruce Jenner is a Republican and wish him happiness, even if I can't understand it,"" said Johnny McNulty. ""I'll accept Bruce Jenner's choice to live how he wants much easier than leftists will accept his politics,"" CounterMoonbat said on twitter. And this final nugget from Bibi. ""Bruce Jenner: *comes out as a woman* . ""Everyone: ""Yas girl, slay"" ""Bruce Jenner: *comes out as a republican* . Everyone: ""disgusting""","Social media largely supports Jenner .
More people seemed intrigued that he's a Republican ."
4587,"The girlfriend of a teenager with a life-threatening tumour has spoken of how his condition has left him paralysed and unable to dress himself. Jahnae Jackson has put her psychology studies on hold in order to care for her long-term boyfriend, Jackson Byrnes after he was diagnosed with a stage four brain tumour four weeks ago. The 18-year-olds from northern NSW have raised over $80,000 from community generosity for his life-saving surgery to be performed on Wednesday by renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Charlie Teo. 'He's already paralysed and I have to help him do many things, including dress him' Jahnae told Daily Mail Australia. Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI . For the past week Jackson and girlfriend have been desperately raising the sum needed to pay the hospital . Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for specialist who was willing . Three weeks ago Jackson was told by doctors that the tumour was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for a specialist who was willing to perform Jackson's urgent surgery and that's when she found Dr. Charlie Teo from The Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. 'I had to be positive for Jackson as I knew there was always a way to help,' she said. On Monday morning they reached the target on their GoFundMe page, and although they still need an additional $45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees, they are overwhelmed by the community support from the small town of Casino in northern NSW. 'It's absolutely unbelievable that a small town can do so much,' Jahnae said. 'It makes us feel so much better.' Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. 'I was devastated when I found out, but I couldn't really react,' she said. The 18-year-old completed school at the end of last year and admits she wanted to go to university to study psychology or social work but has put it off due to Jackson's condition. 'I'd rather help my boyfriend out and worry about university later,' she said. Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation and instead wants to get it over and done with . After desperately fundraising for a week and finally reaching his goal, Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation. 'I just want to get in there and get it over and done with,' Jackson told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm just really thankful to the community as I didn't think we would raise this much money, it all happened so quickly.' Dr Teo, director of Sydney's Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery, said other surgeons were technically able to perform the surgery but he was the only one prepared to do it. 'People think that it's futile because he's got a malignant tumour and it's very aggressive,' Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's significant weakness down his left side and they think his quality of life is such that he wouldn't want to live anyway.' But Dr Teo said he makes decisions based on what his patients want. For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery . Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four tumour three weeks ago and needed $80,000 for surgery . Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more . 'If a patient really wants it and knows the risks and understands how risky the operation is I'll usually respect the patient's wishes,' he said . 'He is a lovely boy and he's only young. 'I said ""You know you're going to be paralysed"", I've told him the worst case scenario. 'He understands that and he wants to live.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain. Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday . 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. 'It is not a time to be enduring a fight for your life.' Victorian finance, leasing and risk management company Morris Finance have made the largest donation to the cause by pledging $2000. Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday. 'He needs to get some scans on Tuesday and then they will schedule his surgery for the next day,' she said. 'We are all positive.'","Teen with deadly brain tumour has raised $80,000 for emergency surgery .

2045,"Changes: Mark Dawe, head of the OCR exam board, said schoolchildren would only have a short time to use the search engine during tests - and compared it to using a calculator in a maths exam . An exam board boss has today been accused of 'dumbing down standards' after suggesting students should be allowed to use Google in their GCSE and A-level exams. Mark Dawe, head of the  Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations board (OCR), said schoolchildren would only have a short time to use the  search engine during tests - and compared it to using a calculator in a maths exam. He said most pupils now learn through search engines anyway – and teachers should test how students interpret answers, rather than how they find them. Today Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the idea would lead to a 'dumbing down of standards'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a nonsense. 'We have a crisis in standards in this country. We are three years behind the Chinese at the age of 15, we have got universities running remedial courses. 'We have got employers saying too many youngsters are unemployable. 'And here we have the OCR board saying ""let's dumb things down"". Row: Education campaigners say that this would send standards plummeting and said exams are about knowledge not hunting for information . Ranking: According to the latest OECD international rankings on education, from 2013, the UK is behind much poorer countries including Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary . 'You can have an exam on how to use Google, but that is not the same as having a history or geography exam. 'Exams should be about knowledge and understanding. It includes knowledge, therefore we do have to test what children are carrying the in their heads.' It would damage the board's credibility, he insisted, because 'sensible people' want their children to take proper exams. Mr Dawe told the programme that the arguments were the same used in relation to allowing calculators in maths exams. He added: 'You do need to have a base understanding of things. 'Actually, one of the most important things is about understanding what comes up on Google or some search engine. 'It is about understanding the tools they have got available and how to utilise those. 'I think that is a very rich way of learning and a very rich way of assessing. 'That is relevant, that is what they will be doing in working life.' He said Google could be allowed on some papers but not others, depending on the type of questions being asked. 'You ask different questions and it is about interpretation,' he added. 'It's about discussion, it is about application.' He said he could not see Google coming in any time soon but suggested it was 'certainly inevitable' longer term.","Mark Dawe, head of the OCR exam board, said it is like using a calculator .

2128,"With her mother by her side and nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo already in charge of the nursery, the Duchess of Cambridge won't be short of help when the new baby arrives. But Carole Middleton and Ms Borrallo aren't the only ones on standby as the birth of the spare to Prince George's heir approaches. Waiting in the wings is Kate's fiercely loyal inner circle, a mix of school friends, society types and family members such as younger sister Pippa. So who's who? FEMAIL reveals who will be helping the Duchess as she gets to grips with life as a mother of two. PIPPA MIDDLETON . More than just sisters, the Duchess of Cambridge and her younger sibling are also best friends who spend as much time together as possible. 31-year-old Pippa recently returned to London after spending several days with boyfriend Nico Jackson in Geneva and will be close at hand when the baby arrives. Close: The Duchess of Cambridge is extremely close to her 31-year-old sister Pippa Middleton . Her role will echo the one she has played with Prince George, who was described as being 'amazing' by his besotted aunt in an interview last July. Speaking to  the Today show last July, Pippa said: 'He's amazing, a very dear boy. He has brought a lot of pleasure and fun for all of us, the whole family.' Despite her busy schedule, author and athlete, Miss Middleton is a regular visitor to Kensington Palace and Anmer Hall and was part of the party that holidayed with William, Kate and George in Mustique in January. Friends: Pippa, pictured laughing at Wimbledon with her sister, could be godmother to Kate's second child . Quality time: Pippa, seen  ahead of Kate's 2011 wedding, says she still spends a lot of time with her sister . Added Pippa: 'We spend a lot of time together. We still do a lot together as a family. And I think that's really the heart for all of us is having a really close family that we can sort of be normal with each other, treat each other normally. 'And that's sort of kept us all, you know, affixed to the ground.' But it hasn't been all smooth sailing for Pippa, who sources revealed has been a cause of concern to her royal in-laws thanks to her high profile. As a result, she was not among the godparents chosen for Prince George, with royal insiders saying it would have piled even more pressure onto her shoulders. Nevertheless, she has been widely tipped to make it onto the list for royal baby number two - possibly alongside Prince Harry. Wider family: Pippa, behind Kate, posed for Prince George's official christening in October 2013 . CAROLE MIDDLETON . She's been described as a 'super-granny' who boasts a starring role in Prince George's life and oversight of the royal nursery. Now Carole Middleton, 60, is set to do the same for her second grandchild and, according to royal sources, will be part of his or her first few days. Although the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decamped to the Middleton's Berkshire home shortly after the birth of Prince George, this time they will head to Anmer Hall in Norfolk instead. Mrs Middleton is expected to join them there along with proud grandfather Michael and will help Prince George adjust to life as a big brother. Matriarch: Carole Middleton has made no secret of her desire to be a hands-on grandmother . First on the scene: Carole has a central role in Kate's life and was among the first to meet Prince George . Involved: Carole, who helped plan the 2011 Royal Wedding, is expected to spend more time at Anmer Hall . The baby is also likely to spend time at the Middletons' £4.5m country pile, which frequently sees visits from William and Kate. Carole, who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children, has made no secret of her desire to be a hands-on grandmother and, as she has with Prince George, is likely to take the new arrival on jaunts to farmers' markets and to the zoo. EMILIA JARDINE-PATERSON . A friend of William’s from his teenage years and a schoolfriend of Kate’s from Marlborough College, glamorous Emilia Jardine-Paterson has been credited with introducing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Her husband David Jardine-Paterson is the scion of a Scottish landowning family descended from the illustrious Hong Kong banking Jardines and was a contemporary of Prince William's at Eton. Like his wife, Mr Jardine-Paterson also has a Middleton connection: his younger brother, JJ, went out with Pippa  for four years. Close connection: David and Emila Jardine-Paterson are old school friends of William and Kate . Although there have been a few bumps over the years, Mrs Jardine-Paterson, who is one of Prince George's seven godparents, has become a fixture in royal circles. Mrs Jardine-Paterson, an interior designer, is also thought to be partly responsible for the recent redecoration of Anmer Hall, having provided the Duchess with design tips for fabrics, trimmings and furniture. ALICIA FOX-PITT . A 6ft redhead, Alicia Fox-Pitt, the younger sister of Olympic eventing star William, is a loyal friend of Kate’s from her Marlborough College days. Indeed, it was Ms Fox-Pitt who recruited Kate for the now famous Sisterhood rowing team, which planned to cross the Channel for charity. 'She's been training with us,' said Ms Fox-Pitt at the time. 'All being well she will be in the boat. She is a very gifted sportswoman and we played a lot of sport together at school.' The Duchess, who was midway through her temporary separation from Prince William at the time, bowed out when the couple reunited. Nevertheless, the pair remain close friends and Alicia, who married entrepreneur Sebastian Stoddart in 2013, shares Kate's love of all things sport. Close: Alicia Fox-Pitt is a loyal friend of Kate's from her Marlborough College days and a keen athlete . Rowing: Alicia recruited Kate for the  famous Sisterhood rowing team, which planned to cross the Channel . ZARA TINDALL . Princess Anne’s daughter Zara  might be William’s first cousin but the Olympic silver medallist is just as close to Kate. The two, who had their first children just six months apart, are said to be really ‘good chums’ who were thrilled to have had babies so near each other. They are on the ‘same wavelength’, a source told the Mail on Sunday. ‘They like to live and eat organically and Zara has helped Kate get over her fear of horses. 'They share many jokes and Kate can relax in her presence more than any other royal cousin.’ 'Good chums': Kate and Zara are said to have been thrilled to have had babies so close to each other . Godmother: Zara, seen here with husband Mike Tindall at the Chapel Royal, is godmother to Prince George . NATASHA ARCHER . Her job title might be Kensington Palace PA but Natasha - or Tash as she is fondly known  - has become a close confidante and travels around the world with the Duchess. Miss Archer's first foray into the public eye came in July 2013 when she was one of the few people to visit the then newborn Prince George while still at the Lindo Wing. The 28-year-old, who studied Hispanic Studies at King's College London, was seen carrying a dress bag and baby car seat as she made her way inside alongside hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker. PA: Natasha Archer - or Tash as she is fondly known  - has become a close confidante of Kate . Stylist: Although officially Kate's PA, she also dispenses fashion advice to the Duchess of Cambridge . Miss Archer was also a key part of the team to travel Down Under last April and was seen hauling an armful of garment bags off the Royal Australian Air Force jet that flew the couple to Wellington, New Zealand for the first leg of the tour. 'Natasha’s main role is as a PA, but over the last few months she has assisted Kate as a style adviser,' a source told Grazia magazine. 'Natasha and Kate get on very well. She has always supported and advised Kate - and the Duchess loves Natasha’s style, so it seemed like an obvious appointment. 'Natasha has been helping Kate pick outfits for the tour.’ Helping out: The 28-year-old, pictured here in Wellington, also accompanied Kate on the tour Down Under . NATASHA RUFUS ISAACS AND LAVINIA BRENNAN . Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs is an old friend of the Duchess - and is married to Kate's former boyfriend Rupert Finch with whom she recently welcomed baby daughter Georgia. Her father, the Marquess of Reading, is also close to Prince Charles and as a result, Lady Natasha has known Prince William since she was a little girl. Lady Natasha also has a fashion connection to the Duchess and runs one of  Kate and Pippa's favourite brands, Beulah London, alongside fashion designer and best friend, Lavinia Brennan. Chum: Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs is an old friend of Kate's and runs Beulah London with Lavinia Brennan . The design duo are part of an exclusive group of designers to be worn regularly by the Duchess, who memorably opted for a bespoke Beulah London dress for her visit to a Malaysian mosque in 2012. ‘We never know when she is going to wear something, but we do know she has when we see a push on the website,' said Miss Brennan of the Kate effect. 'It’s only ever a little one and it’s always from the US. We don’t sell out overnight.' ALICE ST JOHN WEBSTER . Alice was in the same year as Kate at Marlborough College, the Wiltshire public school that Pippa also attended. During their school years, Ms St. John Webster was in the school tennis team with Pippa and Kate and also attended Edinburgh University with Miss Middleton, where she studied French and Spanish. An integral member of the ‘Glosse Posse’, the young and glamorous Gloucestershire polo set, she is also a close friend of  Guy Pelly and Alicia Fox-Pitt. At the Royal Wedding, Ms St John Webster was given a prime seat in the Statesmen’s Aisle, next to Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs, and behind Prince William’s ex-girlfriend, Arabella Musgrave. The mother-of-one, who is married to Gerald Alvenel, a French banker at Merrill Lynch, now lives in Fulham (well-placed for visits to Kensington Palace) and teaches French and Spanish.","School friends and Prince William's family  will play crucial supporting role .

9731,"With just 10 days to go until the general election, Ed Miliband has already won one political battle – as the nation's 'best looking' political leader. First it was the 'milifandom' – with thousands of teenage girls allegedly swooning for the Labour leader on Twitter. But now it seems he's gained another big fan in the form of The Only Way Is Essex star Lydia Bright. The Only Way Is Essex star Lydia Bright met Labour leader Ed Miliband as part of the 'useyourvoice' campaign encouraging young people to vote . The reality TV star said Mr Miliband 'definitely' topped her list of political leaders in a game of 'snog, marry or avoid' The reality TV star said Mr Miliband 'definitely' topped her list of political leaders in a game of 'snog, marry or avoid'. Bright, who interviewed the Labour leader as part of a campaign to encourage youngsters to vote, said she would 'snog or marry Ed because he's the best-looking one out of them all'. She added: 'He had a really great dress sense and looked very dapper. He gets my fashion seal of approval.' It comes after a group of female fans left Westminster watchers baffled after taking to Twitter in droves to reveal their love for the Labour leader. Dubbing themselves the 'Milifans' the mostly teenage girls rallied support for the opposition leader using the Twitter hashtag #milifandom. Bright said she teased the Labour leader over his unlikely sex symbol status. The 24-year-old said: 'I had a bit of a joke with him as well and talked to him about his massive fan base and he seemed very humbled and a bit embarrassed by it. 'But he was also pretty cool about it all. He just really wants those fans tweeting about him to vote for him.' Ed Miliband - arriving at the Arc Arts Centre in Stockton-on-Tees in the North East this morning - has become an unlikely pin up . The Labour leader last week found that he had thousands of 'Milifans' on Twitter - mostly teenage girls - who were rallying support for him and praising his good looks . Bright interviewed the Labour leader as part of the 'useyourvoice' Twitter campaign which encourages young people to vote. She said: 'I wanted to talk to him about what Labour would do about the amount of parents who can't afford to look after their children because those children often end up in care. It's a shocking issue that's really personal to me. 'You'd think all the politicians would be quite posh and a bit pompous but he just seemed really friendly.' Bright's parents have been fostering children since she was 13 months old. Despite consistently voting, Bright admitted she is not a 'political whizz kid', but said she was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to chat to Mr Miliband. But she confessed she still hasn't decided how she will vote as she is determined to do more research and get a better understanding of each party's manifesto 'to get a really clear picture in my mind before I vote on May 7'. The 'useyourvoice' campaign encourages 18 to 30-year-olds to vote in the General Election.","Reality TV star said Mr Miliband 'definitely' topped her list of politicians .

439,"Jurgen Klopp rejected the overtures of West Ham United after handing in his notice at Borussia Dortmund. No matter, it was worth a try. Now on to the next one. If Rafael Benitez wants to return to English football after leaving Napoli maybe he can be persuaded to take over a project that includes a move to the iconic Olympic Stadium in a year's time. West Ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture. Sam Allardyce isn't that man. He had his chance and did not take it. Allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club, but the momentum of his season changed on Boxing Day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at Chelsea, and lost. Sam Allardyce is not the man to lead West Ham into their new exciting adventure at the Olympic Stadium . Allardyce (left, pictured behind Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini) has not been up to scratch . Click here to read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's brilliant column on Jack Grealish . The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures, losing to Arsenal and drawing with West Brom. If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game — 31 points from 17 matches — they would now be fifth in the league. Had their form since that day been played out through the season — 12 points from 16 games — they would be bottom. Allardyce's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival, but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football. If a new manager is being considered, it is understandable. West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival. Rafael Benitez could return to English football after Napoli and may be persuaded by the Hammers project .","Sam Allardyce had his chance with West Ham but has failed to take it .

8995,"A British-born street artist is taking a bold stand against American culture in his most recent piece currently on display across Los Angeles. This week, artist Plastic Jesus put up seven 'NO Kardashian Parking Anytime' signs around Hollywood, including in front of the Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian-owned clothing store Dash and other hot spots such as the Ivy Restaurant and Cecconi's on Melrose. Plastic Jesus told The Hollywood Reporter that he came up with the idea for the piece while driving down Melrose Avenue a few weeks ago. London-born street artist Plastic Jesus erected several 'No Kardashian Parking Anytime' signs around Los Angeles this week - including one right outside the Kardashian sister's clothing store Dash . Plastic Jesus says he got the idea while driving down Melrose Avenue in L.A. a few weeks ago, when traffic was brought to a standstill because of a Kardashian shopping on the street . The Kardashian family pictured above attending Easter celebrations at a church in Calabasas, California on April 5 . He says traffic came to a complete halt when one of the Kardashian sisters walked out of a storefront and paparazzi swarmed to grab a picture. Plastic Jesus remembers thinking 'How has this become a news event?' 'The Kardashian family has become ingrained in our culture,' he said. 'We've allowed mainstream media to become so profit-driven, we are sacrificing genuine news stories to satiate our vapid celebrity obsessions.' 'I guarantee that same number of paparazzi was far greater than any number of photographers chasing real news.' After the incident on Melrose, Plastic Jesus thought up an idea to draw attention to the obsession with reality TV stars . 'The Kardashian family has become ingrained in our culture. We've allowed mainstream media to become so profit-driven, we are sacrificing genuine news stories to satiate our vapid celebrity obsessions,' Plastic Jesus said . Plastic Jesus says the stunt was not meant to target the Kardashians specifically but the reality TV star obsession in general . Plastic Jesus has been compared to street artist Banksy for his graffiti in L.A. He received attention recently for spraying signs that read 'Stop Making Stupid People Famous' around the town and for a touching tribute to Robin Williams following the actor's death . Anonymous: Above, a picture of the street artist posted to his Instagram page . However, Plastic Jesus says the signs aren't meant to single out the Kardashian family specifically, but rather the whole world of reality television. 'These signs are intended to be a practical joke and cause amusement. I hope the Kardashians will see the funny side of it. I don't have a problem with them,' he told the New York Daily News.

10345,"Arrested: Arnold Quintero from San Antonio, Texas . A man has been arrested after a 13-year-old girl was imprisoned, beaten, sexually assaulted and burned with a lighter in America. Arnold Quintero, 21, from San Antonio, Texas faces a string of charges after the girl told police she was punched and forced to undress in front of her attacker. He faces two charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, one of sex performed by a child under 14, bodily injury to a child, evading arrest and possession with intent to deliver, according to the Houston Chronicle. The girl was interviewed by the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office Criminal Investigations Division last month, according to the arrest warrant statement. She said she had been held in a 'trap' house between January 21 and February 8 and was punched in the face, resulting in black eyes and a bleeding nose. A 'trap house' is a term normally used to define a crack house, or a place where drugs are sold. The girl told police a lighter was held to the side of her face, burning her. According to the Houston Chronicle, the girl was forced to undress and the man took  photographs and had sex with her. The statement said the 13-year-old identified Quintero about a month after the interview in a photographic lineup.

'I didn't want to be stupid and get knocked out,' Johnson said. 'I had 25 minutes. I just took my time, and with 1 second left, I figured I better finish him.' Demetrious Johnson retained his UFC flyweight title with a win over Kyoji Horiguchi in Montreal . Johnson celebrates after a successful defence of his title at th Bell Centre in Canada on Saturday . The American secured a submission victory over Horiguchi in the latest UFC pay-per-view event . Horiguchi was dangerous in the opening round, as his blend of unorthodox, karate-based movements and impressive speed gave the champ some pause in the early going. But the Japanese contender was unable to truly capitalize on the opportunities, and it would cost him. Johnson (22-2-1) simply took over in the second round, showing the wide range of skills that have earned him recognition as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters. Constant pressure from the champ left Horiguchi (15-2) struggling to find any opportunity to attack. Instead, the challenger was constantly forced to try and prevent Johnson from taking his back, as they battled routinely against the fence and in the clinch.

The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid?

7521,"Atten-shun! The three leaders’ wives were on parade yesterday, marching across the country in support of their men, in support of the political party into which they married, in support of desperately important employment issues – keeping their idiot husbands in a job. In the corridors of power, Samantha Cameron, Justine Miliband and Miriam Clegg proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers, in more ways than one. Indeed, Samantha and Justine marched out in almost identical uniforms; dark slacks and blazers, paired with crisp shirts and sensible shoes. They looked like a pair of lady pilots from the budget Deficit airline, ready for their long haul flight to or from the land of Austerity, depending on whose husband wins. The only accessory missing were their welfare caps, which they must have left at home. Scroll down for video . In the corridors of power, Samantha Cameron, Justine Miliband  (left) and Miriam Clegg (right) proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers, in more ways than one . Sam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wife. That was until she visited a Sikh family for a cup of tea. Mrs Cameron respectfully took her shoes off before entering the home of local businessman Baljinder Hansraas and before anyone could scream: ‘Holy footcream!’ she unleashed them. Out popped a pair of startling tootsies, displaying what might just have been a hint of a bunion. All across the Home Counties, fragrant Tory women fell into a dead faint. For Sam Cam’s seldom seen feet seemed ever so slightly unkempt, unusual from a woman noted for her effortless elegance. They didn’t even seem very Tory toenails. Shriek – not even a drop of nail polish! I don’t know what the grooming squad will have to say about that, but I doubt it will be very flattering. Sam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wife . Perhaps we should not be too harsh. Not many women would come out smelling of roses and peppermint foot lotion if they unexpectedly had to reveal their workaday feet, still slightly steaming from punishing the pavements, to the nation. Yesterday’s shock unveiling of Crinkletoes Cameron was reminiscent of a moment during the last election, when Sarah Brown’s mangled trotters were revealed on a visit to a Hindu temple. The same furore greeted Brown’s podiatric horror story. And the message was the same. Woman goes out in public without painted toenails? The end of civilisation is nigh. Poor Sam Cam. If she had unveiled the perfect trimmed pedicure and three glistening coats of Rouge Noir, she would be accused of being self-indulgent. Wasting money on luxuries or wandering around with battered trotters. She can’t win. But in this election, who can? Justine resolutely wore the exact same outfit she wore last week, sending out a Take Me Serious message that Clothes Don’t Matter. Campaigning in Bradford, she looked like a grim pixie determined to prove to the Milifans that her man was the man. Or something like that. It was left to Miriam to show a bit of wackitude, pulling on a huge smile, a pair of Lib Dem yellow chinos and a nautical Breton top; she looked like Tweety Pie reporting for duty on the good ship Doomed. Miriam dragged her husband Nick along to a cookery lesson at a Wiltshire primary school. Aprons on, they exchanged loving looks as they and the pupils were shown how to make a variety of desserts using apples and blackberries. Soft fruit, fool, pudding and crumble? That is the history of the Lib Dems right there. Just a week to go and the wifely bandwagon rolls on. Their role is to be there, be visible, be bland and say nothing of import. In this carefully manicured – if not pedicured – election, the days of loudmouth Cherie wading in like a docker with gout have long gone. I almost miss them. Today’s wives must smile nicely. Today’s wives must not rock the boat. Today’s wives must wear ordinary high street clothes and nothing that hints at their secret, massive wealth – although Samantha’s two hundred quid spotty blouse must have slipped under Tory central office radar. Above all, however, today’s wives must remember that pulling your socks up is not as important as keeping them on.","All the party leader's wives have been spotted looking stylish in trousers .

7706,"Tuesday night against Italy could be the most important England game Michael Carrick has ever played. The difference between the first and the second half was like night and day. When Carrick came on, England started to play. Having played in his position, and alongside him, it has been frustrating to see him unappreciated in this country. We have always had a major problem keeping the ball, but Carrick keeps the game simple. That’s exactly what we need. Roy Hodgson’s team against Italy looked like he had one eye on the future, but the only future England need to be focusing on is Euro 2016. If that means going with a 34-year-old Michael Carrick in the heart of midfield, so be it. Tuesday night's friendly clash with Italy  could prove to be Michael Carrick's most important England game . England international Carrick keeps the game simple but has been unappreciated in this country . Carrick congratulates Andros Townsend following the Tottenham wideman's equaliser against Italy in Turin . WAYNE ROONEY . ‘The best player on the pitch by a mile was Michael Carrick. He came on and dictated the game for us.’ PAUL SCHOLES (last week) ‘He is not a flash footballer. He doesn’t hit Hollywood passes. He doesn’t score lots of goals. But I loved playing alongside him.’ SIR ALEX FERGUSON (in December) ‘I still think Michael Carrick is the best central midfield player in English football, I really do. I think he is the best English player in the game.’ Even though he’s 33 now, it’s still not too late to start building the midfield around him. If I were England manager, that’s just what I’d do. Look at Andrea Pirlo — he is 36 next month and has blossomed in his later years. His passing tore England apart at the World Cup and he is worshipped in Italy. Why can’t we love Carrick in the same way? The fact he has been ignored by England for so long is a sad indictment of where we have been going wrong for so many years. In this country we tend to focus a lot on what players can’t do rather than what they can. We love all-action players like Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard but that’s why men like Carrick can be left frustrated. It was not long ago that defensive midfielders had to snap into every tackle. At Manchester United in particular, Carrick has had to deal with ‘Keane Syndrome’ — because he’s not Roy Keane. He’s not as mobile, he doesn’t grab games in the same way and he certainly doesn’t tackle like Keane. But that is not his style. Keane was an amazing player but there will never be another like him and the game has evolved. Carrick and Ryan Mason (left) applaud the travelling England support following Tuesday's 1-1 draw with Italy . Fans love all-action players like former England midfield stars Frank Lampard (left) and Steven Gerrard . Andrea Pirlo, who turns 36 next month, tore England apart with his passing at last summer's World Cup . The best deep-lying midfielders of recent years have been passers, not pit bulls: Pirlo, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, Sergio Busquets. All of them are cultured players who look after the ball. And don’t be fooled by a powerhouse like Nemanja Matic — he can pick out any kind of pass with that left foot. These aren’t just defensive destroyers any more, these are the men starting the attacks. They may not have the best stats for goals or assists, but they are at the heart of it all. It’s the same with Andres Iniesta and Luka Modric — they keep things ticking over, as does Carrick. He makes the passes that lead to the key pass. The midfield that started in Turin was powerful and athletic, but sometimes you need a bit of guile. In a way, it was a good job the first half was so poor as it meant Carrick could come on and really show what he can do. Friendlies might be a good time to experiment but that first half in Italy made for some uncomfortable viewing. Phil Jones has had a decent season at centre back but looked awkward in midfield and England’s passing was too slow and square. Carrick changed that. All of a sudden there was a different tempo to the game. England were fluid and found more room to move against a tough opponent. When he gets possession, Carrick quickly gets the ball out of his feet and tries to slide passes forward. He’s not the toughest of tacklers but he doesn’t need to be. He reads the game brilliantly and intercepts the ball so well that he doesn’t need to go charging after people. He has fantastic vision, which means his team-mates can get into dangerous positions. They know that if anyone can pick out a pass, it’s Carrick. He is so comfortable on the ball and probably England’s most two-footed player since Glenn Hoddle. He’s not in Hoddle’s class, but he is so well balanced with both feet. Carrick takes on midfield rival Roberto Soriano during England's 1-1 draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium . Xavi and Nemanja Matic are two of the world's best deep-lying midfielders and both have an eye for a pass . Carrick's introduction against Italy changed the game, the tempo and saw England become more fluid . I’ve said it before but Carrick has a nasty habit of passing to his own players. It might not look flash but he makes the game look easy. That’s why so many of his team-mates love playing alongside him. He might be a quiet personality but you can see the effect he has on those around him. United have been far better with him than without him this season and Daley Blind, who many thought would replace him, has been shunted out of position. That’s because Carrick is a better player in that role. It’s also important to have experience in that position — I’ve never felt it’s one for a young player. Hodgson has tried Jack Wilshere but Carrick knows the role at club level. Of course Wilshere could play next to him, but at present Carrick is the best man for the job. Considering he won his first cap against Mexico in 2001, it’s amazing he has not featured more for England. He has not always taken his chances, but now is a golden opportunity to build our midfield around him. It’s still not too late to make sure England have a pass master in place for Euro 2016. Carrick, who made his debut in 2001 (right), could become England's third-longest serving player at the Euros .","Michael Carrick changed the game for England against Italy in Turin .

151,"Comedian Dave Hughes has refused to apologise for calling radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television. Hughes and Hinch appeared on Monday night's Q&A panel discussing depression and alcohol, following the emergence of a video featuring Prime Minister Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a pub. Audience member Lauren Hayes asked Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb if he thought Mr Abbott's  'display of irresponsible drinking was an act of peer pressure or an attempt to become more popular with younger voters'. Scroll down for video . Australian comedian Dave Hughes (pictured) called radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television . This sparked Hinch to question if binge drinking was as prevalent back when he was younger as it was today. But Hughes interjected and said this culture had existed and people drank to get drunk. To which the radio personality replied: 'I drank because I like the taste of wine.' Without missing a beat, the Australian comedian fired back: 'That's because you're a w**ker.' Hinch (above) and Hughes were on ABC's Q&A on Monday night discussing alcohol and depression . But Hinch would not have any of it, saying: 'It takes one to know one.' Hughes told Kiis 101.1 radio he would not recant his comment about Hinch. 'I absolutely stand by it. In that moment, and I think Derryn would agree... he was a w**ker,' the comedian said on Tuesday morning. And the veteran radio personality did not seem to mind the put down. 'I've been insulted by experts so I can handle it,' Derryn told the Melbourne radio station. 'I thought David Hughes was quite quiet last night. The episode came after a video surfaced of Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a Sydney pub on the weekend . Mr Abbott downed a schooner of beer in about six seconds while patrons cheered and encouraged him . 'Normally I look at him and he belongs to that breed of... comedians who think the louder you tell a joke the funnier it gets. I wasn't offended.' On social media, one Twitter user stood behind the radio broadcaster, saying: 'Boogly-eyed comedian Dave Hughes' high-horse 'w**ker' comment was way out of line; great response.' Another called Hughes out by using the comedian's same insult: 'Dave... is a w**ker.' But others were supportive of Hughes' view. '[Hughes] calling [Hinch] a w**ker... gold!' one supporter said. 'Hughesy is winning [Q&A] because you're a w**ker hinch,' another Twitter user said. Monday night's Q&A also saw a more serious Hughes tell the audience about his battles with alcohol and depression. 'When I was 21, I was drinking heavily and smoking marijuana and having sort of episodes at night, and I said to my mum that I think I've got schizophrenia,' the comedian said. 'We went to the doctor together - she was a beautiful mother - obviously, she helped me out. 'The doctor, we had a chat about it. I told him I smoked marijuana and he told me, made me stop doing that. And I did, stopped smoking marijuana and I stopped drinking.

10738,"The most popular cities in the world are often instantly recognisable thanks to their world-famous landmarks. But what would these cities look like if they did not have their prized attractions? That's what one studio asked its designers, and the images it received back were certainly illuminating. Scroll down for video . Without the 324m-high Eiffel Tower in Paris, the skyline looks incredibly bare and dark, which is not surprising considering it has 336 lamps illuminating it at night . The iconic tower, on the Champ de Mars, was opened in 1889 and has come to define the French capital . The Arc De Triomphe was constructed in 1806, and is the centrepiece of Place Charles de Gaulle at the end of the Champs-Élysées . The imposing monument celebrates France's military glories and also its military heroes - tourists can climb up tot the roof for beautiful views of Paris . Virtual studio DesignCrowd invited people to submit before and after graphics of some of the most well known landscapes as we have never seen them before. Nearly 100 submissions have been created, with a number of them focusing on the 300m-high Eiffel Tower in their creations . The startling absence of the giant tower left the landscape feeling bare and flat, although it did allow for views from the Trocadéro Gardens, through to the Champ de Mars. More missing features in Paris included the impressive Arc De Triomphe. Instead of leading to the famous centrepiece, the multiple surrounding roads meet at a bare, round circle. Without the Statue of Liberty to draw boats of tourists, Liberty Island looks forlorn and barren. All that remains of the island is the paved stone where the iconic colossal neoclassical sculpture stood. The Statue of Liberty draws boats of tourists every day, but without the iconic lady, Liberty Island looks nothing special . Siena Cathedral is a medieval church in Siena, Italy that has been around since 1215. Its spires and towers peek over the city . The River Thames looks just like any other river with the elegant Tower Bridge stretching across the waterway . The iconic Tower Bridge is featured in nearly every London tourist shop and often mistakenly referred to by visitors as London Bridge . Designers imaged what London would look like without its most photographed clocktower and Westminster Palace . The Palace of Westminster is more commonly known as the Houses of Parliament, with both the House of Commons and House of Lords based in the Gothic-style waterfront building . London's attractions draw millions of tourists every year, but there would be a lot less photographs taken in the city if Big Ben was not a feature on the skyline. It is said to be the most photographed clock in the world, and would not be easy to remove, sitting at over 13 tons. The sunset skyline looks empty without the impressive architecture of the Palace of Westminster. The banks of River Yamuna, in Agra, look desolate with the majestic presence of the Taj Mahal . The Taj Mahal is a striking white marble mausoleum in Agra, and brings millions of tourists to the surrounding area . A certain Holy presence is missing from the skyline of Rio de Janeiro, making the normally instantly-recognisable city a little more mysterious . Christ the Redeemer overlooks all the goings on in Rio, and makes the city instantly recognisable . The Sydney Harbour stands out due to its uniquely designed opera house, which resembles the sails of a ship, without it the skyline looks like any other cluster of skyscrapers . The beautiful monastery carved out of red rock in Petra, Jordan, was originally part of a Nabataean . The rose-red Petra is Jordan's most prized tourist attraction, and hopefully, being a UNESCO World Heritage Site, will never disappear . Machu Picchu was only rediscovered by western travellers in 1911, leading to the site being excavated and becoming a tourist attraction . The ruins at the Inca settlement of Machu Picchu in Peru have made the area a bucket list favourite . Niagara Falls without the falls is a dry, barren hole, and would not attract the 12 million annual visitors it does today . On the border of the US and Canada, Niagara Falls is actually made up of three separate waterfalls . The designs also featured landmarks outside of typical city backdrops. Without the tumbling 51-metre-high Niagara Falls, the area left behind would not pull the 12 million annual visitors that it sees every year. While the Andes are an incredible sight by themselves, iconic pictures with the ruins at the Incan settlement of Machu Picchu, have made the area a bucket list favourite.

5705,"Baylee Almon should be gearing up for her first legal drink on Saturday. Probably at college, probably able to drive, she should be toasting the next phase of her life with her mother, stepfather, brother, sister and cousins at home in leafy Choctaw, Oklahoma. But no, she was one of 19 toddlers killed in a daycare center on April 19, 1995, in the worst case of homegrown terrorism America has ever seen, the day after her first birthday. The Oklahoma City bombing, planted by veteran US Army soldier Timothy McVeigh, killed 168 American people. One photograph encapsulated the terror: a firefighter emerging from the burning wreckage cradling the lifeless body of Baylee Almon. Her 23-year-old single mother saw the picture on the front page of the local paper the next day. A day later, it had swept the world. Two decades on, the shock is still raw. One photograph encapsulated the terror: a firefighter, Chris Fields, emerging from the burning wreckage cradling the lifeless body of Baylee Almon . 'It doesn't get easier': Aren Almon-Kok, pictured at the memorial for her daughter Baylee, who was killed in the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 the day after her first birthday . Then a 23-year-old single mother, Aren saw the picture of her lifeless daughter on the front page of the local paper the next day. A day later it was on the cover of newspapers across the world . Painful: Aren said she learns to deal with the grief but the milestones get more difficult every year. Baylee (pictured) had just turned one when Aren dropped her off at a daycare center before going to work . Remembering: Aren and her family throw a party for Baylee on her birthday every year . Horrific: Aren describes how she searched for hours for Baylee until eventually, in St Anthony's Hospital, she was approached by a priest and a pediatrician who delivered the devastating news . 'It gets harder every year,' Aren Almon-Kok told DailyMail.com from her home on the outskirts of Oklahoma City, where she lives with her husband and two children. 'People say ""it’ll get easier"" or ""you’ll find closure"". I don’t think it does, and I don’t think I will. 'I had to see Baylee dead every day. No one should ever have to see that. 'You learn to deal with it differently, but every year the milestones are worse. ’Sixteen was hard. Twenty-one is the worst. Everything I missed, everything I didn’t get to be part of. I’m trying not to think about it.’ As the 20-year anniversary approaches, many still feel betrayed and bemused by the attackers, who branded themselves patriots. Unlike Dzokhar Tsarnaev and the 9/11 hijackers, Timothy McVeigh had fought for his country in the Gulf War. Parking a rented Ryder truck loaded with explosives outside the Alfred P Murrah building that morning was his way of attacking the 'tyrannical' federal government. He told a court he wanted revenge for the 76 lives lost in a fire at the Waco barracks in Texas, exactly two years earlier, when the FBI ham-handedly tried to expel intruders. He was executed in 2001, and his co-conspirator Terry Nichols, now 60, remains in jail serving 161 life sentences. Even before investigators identified the American perpetrators, the country was struggling to understand the concept of terrorism in Oklahoma City. When the building exploded at 9.01am, Mrs Almon-Kok thought it was construction work. But word soon reached her office, and she spent the next two hours scouring hospitals for her only child. Eventually, sitting in the crammed waiting room at St Anthony’s Hospital, she was approached by a pediatrician and a priest who delivered the news. She didn’t know aspiring photojournalist Charles Porter had captured the moment Baylee was carried from the building, her pink socks stained red from the shards of glass, in a picture that would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize. 'I was very young at the time, I was 23,' she said. 'My parents saw the picture on the paper the next morning and tried to hide it from me. I came downstairs looking for something to read and they said ""we didn’t get any mail today"". 'I knew that was ridiculous, we always got the paper. So I went looking around for it and, yes, as soon as I saw it I said, ""that’s Baylee"". The Oklahoma City bombing, planted by veteran US Army soldier Timothy McVeigh, killed 168 people . It was the worst case of homegrown terrorism America has ever seen, and shook the nation . Unlike Dzokhar Tsarnaev and the 9/11 hijackers, Timothy McVeigh had fought for his country in the Gulf War . Then-President Bill Clinton responded to the attack days later with one of his most famous speeches: 'The loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives.’ Then-First Lady Hillary Clinton holds her face in distress at the ceremony to remember the dead in 1995 . 'For some reason I thought I would know if my daughter was going to be on the front page. It was strange, it was horrible. 'Everybody else saw it as fiction - she wasn’t a person. They made money off it like she wasn’t real.' To the Almon-Kok family, she is very much still with them. Aren Almon met Army veteran Stanley Kok through a friend soon after the attack. They married in 1997, and together they have two children: Bella, 17, and Brooks, 13. Every year they throw a birthday party in Baylee’s honor, with a cake and a family meal. Bella and Brooks know they are two of three siblings. 'My husband has been really great, he has always been supportive of what I've been through and to him, Baylee is part of our life together. 'My kids have always known that they have a sister and that she went to heaven, so they expect us to celebrate her birthday like we do theirs. 'For them, the picture is painful too. 'Bella did a paper at school the other day about commercials and how they use images. One of the photographs they were given was that picture. 'She just dealt with it the best way she can. That’s her sister, she knows what happened. So to see that picture, that hurts.' Nonetheless, the family has been the subject of scrutiny, anger and at times hatred in the wake of the attacks. With her child the 'face' of the tragedy, other grieving families felt Aren Almon and the firefighter, Chris Fields, stole the limelight from their loved ones who paled into oblivion. During the barrage of media attention, the pair grew a bond, which remains today - and it was erroneously assumed they had become romantically involved. 'We do still see each other, Chris and his wife have been very supportive, they are such good people. But they won't be coming to the ceremony, they keep themselves out of that stuff. 'That whole thing was difficult, and just something else you have to learn how to deal with.' Consequently, Almon-Kok is apprehensive about this year’s 20-year anniversary ceremony. 'We don’t all have something in common just because we lost a child,' she explains. Tough: Aren has been the subject of scrutiny, anger and at times hatred in the wake of the attacks . Aren Almon met Army veteran Stanley Kok through a friend soon after the attack. They married in 1997, and together they have two children: Bella, 17, and Brooks, 13 . Difficulty for all of them: Aren said her children (pictured) know that they are two of three siblings . Other grieving families felt Aren Almon and the firefighter, Chris Fields, stole the limelight from their loved ones who paled into oblivion after the photograph received so much attention (pictured: the memorial) 'I know after the bombing the other families didn’t like me, and I’m not looking forward to that. 'I have just always tried to represent myself the best way possible because when Baylee’s looking down at me from heaven I want her to be proud of the things I have done. 'I didn’t want any of this, to see Baylee dead everywhere every day, but that’s just the way it happened.' Between the ages of 23 and 43, Almon-Kok, has dedicated herself to ensuring daycare centers are fully secure. Congressional bill number HR 4159, or 'Baylee’s Law', became law in 2000 to ensure a standard of glass protection in public buildings. McVeigh had enlisted his co-conspirators to build a car bomb that would shatter the windows of the building - a horrific detail that severely impacted the force of the explosion. It took weeks to find an attorney to represent Timothy McVeigh after he was coincidentally detained during a traffic stop 45 minutes after the attack. Eventually, Stephen Jones agreed to defend his actions ’to ensure he had a fair trial’. Speaking this week, Jones conceded: 'We all remember what we were doing. It is the Pearl Harbor Day of Oklahoma. 'This was a scar and never-ending wrong that affected not only Oklahoma City and the people there but the nation at large,' he told Tulsa Rotary. Then-President Bill Clinton responded to the attack days later with one of his most famous speeches: 'The loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives.’ Indeed, Oklahomans earned a reputation for compassion in the wake of the bombing - a sense of charity that came to be known as 'The Oklahoma Standard'. On Sunday, in a ceremony held at 9.01am at the site of the attack, Clinton and city officials will lead tributes to the city’s resilience, and read out the names of the 168 people who lost their lives. And the picture of Chris Fields holding Baylee will be shown. Though heart-wrenching for her, she says she is attempting to compartmentalize it. ’If I saw Baylee every time I looked at that photograph, I wouldn’t be able to get past that. I wouldn’t be able to carry on,’ she said. 'To me, basically, I try to see that picture as something which represents everybody who died in that bombing. It’s everybody’s baby.'","It is 20 years since the worst case of homegrown terrorism in US history .

9522,"A New York-based writer who has grown tired of the battle between fat and skinny, is blaming plus-size retailer Lane Bryant for continuing to perpetuate the weight war — and has published candid photos of herself wearing the brand's lingerie to illustrate the problem. In an essay published on xoJane, Amanda Richards hit out at Lane Bryant’s recent I’m No Angel lingerie campaign, which was widely perceived to have been a rather blatant critique of popular lingerie giant Victoria’s Secret. The clothing store, which carries US sizes 14 to 28, has been applauded for the new campaign, which shows plus-size models looking sexy in the brand's lingerie. But while many people responded that it was encouraging to see women of different sizes being portrayed as sexy, offering a counterpoint to stick-thin models like Victoria's Secret Angels Candice Swanepoel, Behati Prinsloo, and Lily Aldridge, Amanda takes issue with its message. Regular girl: Writer Amanda Dobbins says Lane Bryant's new I'm No Angel ad campaign doesn't show plus-size women of different proportions . 'I don't think it's particularly healthy or progressive to pit fat bodies against thin bodies,' she says. Amanda explains that part of the problem is that Lane Bryant's ads don't actually show women of all sizes, but rather a subset of overweight women who still have 'correct' proportions, with flatter stomachs and larger busts. 'I have never once seen a Lane Bryant customer with a body that is represented, even a little bit, in any of Lane Bryant's advertising campaigns, myself included,' she said. So the self-described 'body-positive' blogger has taken to social media, posting photos of herself in Lane Bryant underwear to her Instagram account in a 'small offering of solidarity' with other women of varying sizes who feel unrepresented in fashion ads. At size 18, Amanda admits, 'I'm no model' — but adds that her body type is also not so unusual. Body positive: Amanda hopes to promote positive body image and wants more retailers to advertise toward women of varying sizes . No retouching: The New York-based blogger posted photos of herself that showed off her figure and stretch marks . She continues to say that she hopes brands like Lane Bryant will learn from women like her, as well as other plus-size women on social media, that customers want to see diverse models in their ads campaigns. Lane Bryant, however, insists its I'm No Angel campaign is diverse and represents 'the woman who unapologetically celebrates herself'. 'This campaign is intended to celebrate all women coming together to redefine the ideals of beauty,' Lane Bryant representative Toyin Graham told Bustle. 'This campaign message is all inclusive. Our issue is not with certain sizes of women, it’s with media’s definition of ideal beauty' But Amanda believes it is not enough, saying: 'We don't derive self-worth from seeing diverse images, but we do find power and solidarity and learn to appreciate our own individuality in relationship to others.' Taking charge: Amanda says she's tired of being told to settle for plus-size fashion taking 'baby steps' 'I can't imagine what the legions of other women, the ones who are strikingly different from these models, must feel,' she adds. Since publishing the photos of herself in lingerie, Amanda has started sharing images of other plus-size women stripped down on her Instagram as well in the hopes that an influx of images of diverse body types will help to spark change. 'I'm so tired of being told that I should be happy with #plussize fashion and representation taking ""baby steps"",' she wrote on Twitter. 'We are women. We are big women. We should not be taking baby steps. We should be taking BIG LOUD RUMBLING GROWN A** WOMAN STEPS.

11381,"The tragic death of a seven-week-old baby in his mother’s bed has led a coroner to demand new guidelines to warn parents of the dangers of sleeping next to newborns. ‘Well cared-for and loved’ Efan James was found lying face down and unresponsive the morning after Hannah James, 26, took him to bed. At the baby’s inquest this week, a coroner in Pembrokeshire said new parents were given ‘confusing’ advice over how tired they could be when they slept in the same bed as their child. Tragedy: Efan James, who was described as 'well cared-for and loved', was sharing a bed with his mother Hannah James (pictured together) when he died in his sleep last October . Co-sleeping: Mrs James had taken her son to bed with her at the family home in Milford Haven, West Wales but the next morning he was 'lying face down and unresponsive', an inquest heard . The Welsh government’s ‘reducing the risk of cot death’ leaflet, which offers similar advice to the NHS in England, says parents should not share a bed with a young baby if they ‘feel very tired’, take drugs, smoke, or have drunk alcohol. But coroner Mark Layton said: ‘The advice is that it is not wrong to share a bed with your baby – but you should refrain from doing so if you are “excessively tired”. This is very confusing. It is a fact of life that parents or carers of a young infant would be very tired because of the baby’s erratic sleep pattern. ‘It suggests that it’s okay to go to sleep with your baby if you are not very tired. But very few people will sleep unless they’re actually tired.’ The bedsharing guidance does stress that the safest place for a baby under six months to sleep is in their own cot in the same room as its parents. But new mothers sometimes struggle with this – especially if they are breastfeeding – because the easiest place to do this is in bed. Miss James had been to a party and had ‘a little to drink’ before she, her baby and a friend all shared the bed at the family home in Neyland, West Wales, in October last year. The next morning Efan was found ‘face down and unresponsive’. Pembrokeshire Coroner Mark Layton said the current advice on 'co-sleeping' is 'confusing' Pembrokeshire Coroner’s Court heard how attempts were made to resuscitate Efan but he could not be saved. Tests later showed his brain had been starved of oxygen.Home Office pathologist Richard Jones told the inquest there was no specific cause of death but it was typical of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death or ‘cot death’. He said: ‘The cause of death might be sudden unexplained death in infancy while bed sharing. Examination showed a suggestion that the brain had an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood shortly before Efan died.’ The coroner recorded an open conclusion and said the death could not be explained on pathological grounds, adding: ‘There is no doubt that he was well cared for and loved by his family. Sadly it is not uncommon for a baby to die with no obvious cause of death.’ The Welsh government said it will consider the coroner’s comments, but said its guidance was ‘very clear’ and was reviewed by experts last year. Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Ruth Hussey said: ‘We will consider the coroner’s correspondence to us and respond appropriately in due course.’ A spokesman for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which issues health guidelines in England and Wales, said: ‘Sharing a bed with your baby at night can aid breastfeeding and in some cultures, co-sleeping is seen as perfectly normal. But the Department of Health advises that the safest place for a baby to sleep is in a cot.’ The clinical director of the NHS watchdog has admitted guidelines for preventing cot deaths are ‘confusing’. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published advice for England and Wales in December which told parents there was a strong link between co-sleeping and cot death, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. But guidelines do not tell women they shouldn’t bring their babies into bed – even though it makes the risk of death five times higher. The watchdog stopped short of telling women not to take babies to bed in case the advice interfered with breastfeeding guidelines. Professor Mark Baker, NICE clinical director, said: ‘It’s quite a confusing message, it is not clear. We’re not telling people not to co-sleep, we know that could get in the way with breastfeeding, but there is an association there with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.’ He added: ‘We are between a rock and hard place. The only recommendation we could have made would be to avoid co-sleeping, but it would be seen as incompatible with breastfeeding guidelines.’ There are currently around 300 cot deaths in the UK every year. However Professor Bob Carpenter, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has estimated that around 120 cot deaths could be prevented every year in the UK if parents were advised not to co-sleep.

10092,"A San Antonio man who fatally shot a SWAT team member with the officer's own gun more than 14 years ago was executed on Wednesday. Manuel Garza Jr. received a lethal injection of pentobarbital for killing San Antonio Police Officer John 'Rocky' Riojas in February 2001. He is the sixth convicted murderer to be put to death in Texas this year. The U.S. Supreme Court had refused in November to review his case, and no last-day appeals were filed before his execution. Manuel Garza Jr. was given the death sentence after killing San Antonio Police Officer John 'Rocky' Riojas in February 2001 . Asked to make a final statement, Garza said he was sorry for causing pain to his family, friends and 'especially police officers'. 'Y'all probably hate me,' he said, looking at three friends of his victim, dressed in their navy blue San Antonio police uniforms. He wished them 'peace and love and hope y'all find God like I have and I'll see you on the other side.' As the lethal drug began taking effect, Garza uttered: 'Here it comes!' His voice rose as he said 'Goodbye,' and then he let out a howl that was cut short within seconds as he took three deep breaths, then a couple of shallow ones. He was pronounced dead 26 minutes later at 6.40pm. Before his death, Garza was given the same food as the rest of the inmates in his unit for his final meal because Texas no longer allows special-order last meals, according toLast Suppers. He had a grilled pork chop, sweet potatoes, green beans, black beans, cornbread, and peach cake, with a choice of water, tea, or punch to drink. Garza, 35, already had a long criminal record at age 20 when he was stopped by Riojas, who was part of a team targeting property crimes at apartment complexes. Garza ran off and witnesses say that when Riojas caught up with him, the two struggled and Garza grabbed the officer's gun. Riojas, 37, was fatally shot in the head. Witnesses said Garza put Riojas's gun in his pants, cursed at the fallen officer, and ran away. Garza was apprehended a day later at his sister's apartment after an informant told detectives that someone had tried to sell him the officer's missing semi-automatic service weapon. In a statement to detectives, Garza blamed Riojas. 'I truly think this was the cop's fault,' he said. 'I don't see why he wanted to pull out his gun.' Garza said he initially ran because he feared the officer would discover he was wanted on outstanding warrants. 'I didn't want to go to jail,' he said. While being escorted to a holding cell after his arrest, court documents described Garza as cocky and smirking. Riojas (pictured), 37, was part of a team targeting property crimes at apartment complexes. Garza fled when he was stopped by Riojas, which led to a struggle and the police officer's death . He used obscenity-laced language to tell officers they were 'lucky I didn't get y'all... too.' The San Antonio Police Officers Association provided buses for officers to make the 200-mile-trip to Huntsville. Several dozen police officers were outside the prison Wednesday evening, and stood at attention and saluted as Riojas' sister - who also is with the San Antonio department and watched Garza die - and the officer-witnesses emerged. 'We want them to see we do care and the salute is a form of respect,' said Mike Helle, president of the association. But Helle, who was in the same police academy training class with Riojas, said the execution 'doesn't bring back my classmate and my friend.' Defense attorneys had said the shooting was accidental and Garza was a product of childhood neglect and abuse. In a 2013 failed appeal, attorney Michael Gross said Garza's family encouraged him to break the law. His criminal record began at age 14, and included burglaries, thefts, escape from custody and leading police on a stolen car chase. Texas carries out the death penalty more than any other state. Garza was the first inmate executed with a new supply of pentobarbital recently obtained by Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials that would allow his and two other lethal injections scheduled for this month to be carried out. If the other two take place, the state prison agency once again will have to replenish its inventory of the scarce drug or find a new chemical to accommodate at least three more scheduled executions beginning next month. Drug manufacturers, under pressure from death penalty opponents, have been withholding their products for use in capital punishment.","Manuel Garza Jr. died from a lethal injection on Thursday .

8594,"A 21-year-old man with depression has made the most gut-wrenching final goodbye video to his family, telling them not to blame themselves and reassuring them there is nothing they could have done to stop him taking his own life. While the chilling song 'Goodbye My Lover' by James Blunt is playing in the background, the distressing three-minute footage shows Chris Ball repeatedly saying that no one should take the blame for his disease and expressing his unconditional love for his mother, four siblings and his girlfriend. On September 14 last year, Chris's brother Jayden - who is only one year younger - and their stepfather found Chris's body along with a USB stick containing the video sitting on top of a piece of paper which simply said: 'Mum and Dad, please watch.' His family have shared the heartbreaking video publicly to raise awareness of the crippling disease, which takes the lives of more young Australians than car accidents and skin cancer, as part of a petition to call for more beds for suicidal youths in hospitals. Scroll down for video . Chris Ball made made the most heartbreaking final goodbye video to his family before taking his own life . Jayden (centre pictured with siblings Matthew, Lara, Maddy and Chris from left to right) found his brother after the devastating tragedy . Chris starts off saying to the camera that this could be his last goodbye and then tells no one to blame themselves because 'depression is a disease and I'm pretty weak-hearted - it doesn't take much for me to get emotional,' he said. 'I just want you to know that I love you all and there was nothing you could have done - it's just me, my personality it's who I am.' He then goes onto talk about his ongoing battle with depression. 'I've been feeling lonely for a while, I know I could get better - I keep trying to tell myself that but I just can't see it,' he said. 'I use alcohol a little bit to help me to get through but if anyone puts on this USB - I love you - there is nothing you could really do.' Chris then signs off by naming all of the most important people in his life - his parents, four siblings and his girlfriend, Holly. 'Holly don't blame yourself - it's not your fault - same with my family - Mum, Dad, Maddy, Lara, Matt, Jay - all of you just didn't do it alright? This is me, myself - I love you - goodbye.' Chris (left) was taken by his mother Kerrie (right) to the hospital 11 days earlier but was sent home with 10 Valium because there was a shortage of beds . The five people in Kerrie's family who committed suicide: her nephew Andrew (top left), her brother John (bottom left) and son Chris (centre), her sister and Andrew's mum - Lenore (right) and her sister Leeann (bottom right) If anyone knows about the devastating impact of suicide it's Kerrie Keepa who has lost her brother, two sisters, nephew and now her son, Chris, to depression. Kerrie said her son would still be with her today if Chris had not been sent home from Redland hospital in Brisbane 11 days earlier because he was told there were not enough beds available. A Metro South Health spokeswoman said it would be inappropriate to provide any details of Chris's care while the coroner was still investigating the matter. 'However, Metro South Addiction and Mental Health Service did provide extensive support to Mr Ball and sufficient mental health beds are available within the Metro South Health area,' she said. On September 3, Kerrie received a hysterical phone call from her son who said he had deliberately cut himself multiple times on his leg. 'We had to wait for four hours and then a doctor gave him 10 Valium and told him to get a good night's sleep and that somebody would contact him in a week or two from the outpatients' department,' she said. 'Then he said to me ""you can look after him can't you?"". 'I said to him ""please don't take this lightly - there is a history of mental illness in my family"" and he just said that there were no beds.' Chris said in his video that his family and girlfriend were not to blame for his 'disease' 'I've been feeling lonely for a while, I know I could get better - I keep trying to tell myself that but I just can't see it,' he said in his video . Although Chris had been suffering from depression for the past two and a half years and had spent two weeks in the hospital during that time after making an attempt on his life, Kerrie said it was the worst state that she had seen her son in. 'I took him to my house and he was so withdrawn and crying the whole time,' she said. 'His best friend Adam and I were on 24 hour suicide watch. 'It was the worst time of my life - I have never seen him so low.' Ten days later, Chris told his mother that Holly was picking him up and taking him to his place so he could have a few drinks with his friends. The next morning, Kerrie was unable to get hold of Chris in her break at work so she asked her husband and Jayden to check on him. 'They heard music but he didn't answer the door so they broke it down and it was Jayden who found him.' Only a year apart in age, Jayden and Chris were not only brothers but best friends. 'Jayden and my husband were having terrible nightmares - Jay kept seeing visions of Chris as he saw him when he broke the door down,' Kerrie said . 'The next day Queensland Mental Health offered us counselling - I just can't get my head around that they wouldn't help Chris when he was alive but offered us counselling after he died.' Before Chris became unwell two years ago, he was a happy and outgoing boy . Chris with his girlfriend Holly and his beloved dog, Bear, in happier times . Kerrie, who works for the health department as an aged care nurse, has started a petition to call on the government to urgently implement emergency suicide training in hospitals and dedicate more beds to suicidal youths in hospitals. 'I will hand deliver the petition to Canberra myself and hope the bloody politicians listen,'she said. 'Mental health is rampant in my family so if any other family members show any sign they have no hope. 'I don't know if I could cope losing another child I think it would be the thing that breaks me - my days are filled with fear.' No matter what happens, Kerrie will always treasure the fond memories of her beautiful son. 'He was the most beautiful boy - he really loved his family - he would walk in and say ""I love you Mother Duck"" and give me a big hug and kiss,' she said. 'Before he became unwell - he was happy and outgoing with a smile that lit up the whole room.' To sign Kerrie's petition go to change.org. Anyone who is suffering from depression or mental health issues should contact Lifeline on 131 114 or Beyond Blue (Australia) the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1800 273 8255 (USA) or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 (UK), or a local help group.","Chris Ball made a video to say goodbye to his family before taking his life .

It was hard to see what Atletico were trying to achieve at times. A victory on penalties perhaps. But when Arda Turan was dismissed in the 75th minute for what looked like a harsh second yellow card for a challenge on the all-too theatrical Sergio Ramos, an opportunity suddenly presented itself to Real. A frustrated figure until Atletico were reduced to 10 men, Cristiano Ronaldo made a jinking, purposeful run into the penalty area before executing the all-important pass. Hernandez had missed his earlier chances. One of them a clear cut opening thanks to a wonderful reverse-pass from Isco. But this time he delivered, the Little Pea scoring arguably the biggest goal of his career with a sweeping effort from 12 yards. In the starting line-up only because of an injury to Karem Benzema, Hernandez performed much as he has all season here. Committed and energetic but just lacking the class of his temporary club-mates. But with this contest only two minutes from moving into extra-time, goalless if far from gutless, Hernandez made no mistake when it mattered most. Ancelotti seems to beat Atletico when it matters most. In last year’s Champions League final. Here on Wednesday night. Seven times already this season these two teams had met and seven times Real had failed to conquer their less glamorous neighbours. But there is a reason why Ancelotti is the only living manager to have lifted the European Cup on three occasions, and today he is a significant step closer to winning the greatest club competition of all for an unprecedented fourth time. It might even secure his position at the Bernabeu, given how uncertain his future appears to be despite delivering La Decima last season. ‘Every game is an exam and tonight we passed the exam well,’ said the amiable Italian with his trademark chuckle. What an extraordinary night it had been. As early as two hours before kick-off the streets around this magnificent stadium were packed with people, their rhythmic chanting rivalled only by the hum of the police helicopters hovering overhead. Champions League nights between two teams from the same country have this special quality. Rarely has an atmosphere been greater in English football than when Chelsea travelled to Anfield for that first semi-final back in 2005. Real Madrid striker Hernandez had been having a frustrating evening for Real Madrid up until his goal in the 88th minute . Hernandez couldn't quite believe how he missed his chance to give Real Madrid the all-important lead at the Bernabeu before his goal . Hernandez's starting place for Real Madrid was described by local media as the 'biggest match of his career' and he lived up to it . But this was extra special. This was a Madrid derby with a difference and the deafening roar that greeted the end of the Champions League anthem said as much. You could barely hear yourself think never mind what the person sat next to you was saying, and it was no different when Turan was dismissed and when Hernandez then struck the decisive blow. For Ancelotti it must have come as something of a relief after the tactical juggling he had to perform in the absence of key personnel. As well as Benzema, Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Marcello were also missing and the decision to deploy Ramos in midfield caused some concern here. After all, only once before had the Italian tried it and after losing 2-1 to Barcelona he admitted to making a mistake. Afterwards he laughed about it too, joking that attempts to kill him last time had proved unsuccessful so he felt safe doing it again. This game quickly followed a familiar theme, with Real pressing deep in the half of the well-drilled Atletico. Simeone, simmering and animated on the sidelines, applauded his players for the naughty challenges as well as the good ones, seemingly happy to see his side play so negatively.

But the chances would come for Real, with Ronaldo forcing a fine save from the impressive Jan Oblak just before the break and Hernandez failing to capitalise on that delightful ball from Isco just after the restart. Only when Turan was dismissed did the breakthrough come, however, Ronaldo and Hernandez exploiting the slight tactical change Simeone had been forced to make as a result of the red card. Atletico’s manager said he had no regrets. ‘I am proud of my players,’ he said. ‘But congratulations to our rivals, who played a good game and scored a beautiful goal.’ Which it was.

3204,"The title race might be all but over but the fight for survival is only just beginning. At the end of March, Leicester were bottom of the table with 19 points, seven off safety. Win on Saturday and they will be out of the relegation zone. For Nigel Pearson and his men, their season starts now. When you’re facing relegation you are supposed to be dispirited and lacking in confidence. So how on earth have Leicester won three on the bounce? Only Arsenal (8) and Chelsea (4) can better that as a winning streak. Leicester players are full of confidence after three successive victories in the Premier League . It has been a superhuman effort and they have fought to get themselves in a position where they have something to play for. Leicester were bottom on Christmas Day but win at Burnley and they will give themselves a real chance of staying up — something only two sides have managed after being bottom at Christmas. It’s not just Leicester, though. The other promoted clubs — QPR and Burnley — have shown fantastic spirit. I have been in relegation battles and seen teams with less fight in them than these three. QPR earned a fantastic win at West Brom, were unlucky to draw at Aston Villa and battled manfully against Chelsea. Burnley might be on a poor run but you know Sean Dyche’s side will battle until the bitter end. So how does a manager create a positive attitude when things look so bad? What you can’t afford to do is let players sit and study the fixtures and start looking at how many points they need. If they are too busy working out the permutations, they’re not concentrating on their game. Leicester face a crunch clash with fellow relegation battlers Burnley on Saturday . If a player is not being pushed it’s easy for them to shift responsibility and hope somebody else gets them over the line. The best thing to do is keep them busy. If you’re working hard on the training ground looking at team shape, developing players and preparing for games, you are making much better use of your time. I’ve been in that situation as a player and the worst thing you can do is to wrap them in cotton wool. There is a tendency to try to protect people in case things go wrong. Training eases up because of injury fears and managers try to keep their players fresh. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has managed to create a positive attitude in his squad . But that leaves you sitting around with your thoughts and that can be dangerous. There needs to be mental stimulation — you can’t sit around and wallow in self-pity. At this stage of the season a week can be a long time between games. Pearson and his players will be absolutely buzzing in training and it’s important to take that energy and intensity into games. It annoys me when managers say it’s all about results. The only way to win is to make sure that your performance is right and that comes from hard work during the week. Pearson has worked hard to make sure Leicester’s destiny is in their own hands. Their form has struck fear into other teams. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring in the 2-0 victory against Swansea . The three promoted sides look brave enough to go out and play, but Sunderland and Hull look paralysed by fear. Steve Bruce thinks Hull’s home form will keep them up but a look at the fixtures shows it won’t be that easy. Leicester, QPR and Burnley have all given their home fans reason to cheer with their efforts and the thrill of the chase means everything is applauded. Contrast that with the toxic feeling at the Stadium of Light. Leicester have taken a long time to wake up but they have rekindled the atmosphere they had when they beat Manchester United. And with four of their last six games at home, they need to keep that up. If they can, and the level of their performance continues to harness the positivity of that home crowd, don’t bet against them making the great escape. Fans still believe that Leicester can still avoid the drop from the Premier League .","Leicester can move out of the drop zone by beating Burnley on Saturday .

6643,"(CNN)Recently, Nashville's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals. Believe it or not, Nashville prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years. There has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in America in 2015 would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal. Except, it happens all the time. Some have claimed this practice ""evokes a dark corner of American history"" where the mentally ill or ""deficient"" were forced to undergo sterilization. Yeah, that's true.  We did that.  And it was bad. Except this isn't quite that. Female sterilization is linked to the controversial ""eugenics"" movement, which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes. There is even a 1927 Supreme Court case, Buck v. Bell, in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and ""imbeciles,"" ""for the protection and health of the state,"" was constitutional.  The opinion in the case is stunning, especially because the Supreme Court has never technically overruled it. But Buck v. Bell dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities, not because they were being punished for a crime. You can hate sterilization, and the Tennessee case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics, but it's not that. Present-day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime, and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment. Others may argue that the Supreme Court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment, and struck it down.  That's true too, sort of. In Skinner v. Oklahoma, the Court struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional, but not because it was cruel and unusual.  Instead, the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes. So the question remains: Is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional? The Eighth Amendment provides: ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."" Practically, however, punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary.  We have executed people with hangings and by firing squad.  Sterilization has to be somewhere below that, right?  Ultimately, however, the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis, because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the Constitution, it is permissible, if you willingly choose it. Suppose arguendo (for argument's sake) that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth Amendment.  This is where it gets interesting: It still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal.  Shocked? You shouldn't be. As citizens, we validly waive our constitutional rights all the time.  You waive your Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure when you answer ""yes"" to an officer's ""Mind if I look in your trunk?"" You waive your Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle's trunk.  So then, if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights, can we waive our Eighth Amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment, even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional? And are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals? Nope. Sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country, and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure. If sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional, and we've been doing it for a while, then that begs the question: Why the outrage now?  Why the story that a Tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced? There are really only two possibilities. First, some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news.  Second, even if we knew about it, we didn't mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference. Most of the sterilization defendants are men. Search your feelings, Luke. When we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters, the idea of castration as punishment doesn't sound so bad right?  Be honest: Let go of your ""we're-all-equal-in-all-ways"" banner for a moment.  After all, not too long ago, execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions. So if we're OK with the gas chamber, we're probably OK with a snip.  It's OK.  You can admit it; we are all hardwired with a modicum of gender bias, whether we like it or not. Still not convinced?  Watch this parlor trick: What if I suggested sterilization for a person convicted of having sex with a minor? So far you're not ruling it out. And what if it's a young female high school teacher having sex with her 17-year-old student? Most of our gut feelings shifted from ""maybe"" to ""no"" just now.  It's OK to admit that, too. Of course, sterilization won't prevent a female sex offender from offending again, no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again.  But the point is, somehow, the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal. Maybe it's that on a primal, unconscious level, what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man.  Even if you're offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a ""shocking"" news story, you must concede it fits. Why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar, but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty?  Of course, we have to consider the related justification. Overall, a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women.  Just ask any domestic violence prosecutor. Are sterilization plea deals morally right?  It's hard to say.  For now, they appear to be constitutional, but controversial.  If we know a mother is likely to kill or seriously hurt her current children or her unborn child, should the government step in?  If so, to what degree?  Fortunately, we can avoid a final decision and continue to attack the problem in a way that seems to be more acceptable for now: just keep neutering the men.","Nashville's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals .

The description for the unsettling video - uploaded to YouTube last week by Raymond Yeung – claims it was captured in the Shenzhen Reservoir in China's Sand Bay. The clawed creature - which some say is a rare bear - can be seen aggressively biting through the cage with a visibly bleeding mouth before ripping the metal wire apart with its limbs. The vision has fuelled heated debates around the species of the ambiguous beast, with a string of different accounts coming to light.

The clip has sparked heated debates on Chinese social media site WeiBo, with some users claiming it depicts a 'water monster' from Chinese folklore.

200,"After experiencing major devastation and loss of life in the April 25 earthquake, Nepal was left with an unsavoury taste in its mouth after receiving packets of ‘beef masala’ as part of the relief package from Pakistan. Since the majority-Hindu country treats cows as sacred and there is a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal, the development has the potential to trigger diplomatic acrimony between the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) member countries. Indian doctors at Kathmandu’s Bir Hospital told Mail Today that packets of ‘beef masala’ were sent by Pakistan on Tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors. These doctors – drawn from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) — are members of a 34-member medical team sent to Nepal for treating the survivors. “When we reached the airport to collect the food items from Pakistan, we found packets of ready-to-eat meals, including packets of ‘beef masala’. There were other food items too,” Dr Balwinder Singh told Mail Today. Perplexed, the doctors chose to have food from a hotel instead. “We did not touch the Pakistani aid,” Dr Singh said. “Most of the local people are not aware of the contents. When they understand, they avoid it,” said another doctor on the condition of anonymity. He added: “Pakistan has hurt Nepal’s religious sentiments by supplying the masala. Shockingly, it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter.” Pakistani soldiers load relief supplies for Nepal . Exclusive photographs of the ‘beef masala’ packets supplied to Nepal are with Mail Today. These pictures clearly show that the place of origin of these packets was Nowshera Cantt in Pakistan. These packets also prominently mention that these are not for sale and the contents include ‘potato bhujia’ and ‘beef masala’. A top Nepal government official said: “The matter has been conveyed to Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and the intelligence chief. We are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts. If the report is correct, we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with Pakistan. India, being our key partner, will also be informed of the developments.” Tasneem Aslam, spokesperson for Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs, told Mail Today: “I am not aware of the issue…I am not responsible for the dispatch. The relief aid is sent by the National Disaster Management Authority.” Nepalese soldiers stand next to wrecked buildings at Durbar Square . A press note uploaded on the website of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Pakistan (http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/), states: “(The) National Disaster Management Authority has dispatched the second of two sorties of C-130 aircrafts on April 28 in collaboration with Pakistan Army, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Pakistan Air Force. The relief goods include 250 tents, 200 food packs (2.6 tonne), 1,000 Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), 1,000 blankets and 33 cartons of medicines. These relief goods have been provided from NDMA stocks….” Despite repeated attempts, the officials of the Pakistan NDMA could not be contacted. The food items have been manufactured by PANA Force Foods. The consignment was supplied after receiving orders from Pakistan’s NDMA. “PANA Force food processing centre aims at providing quality goods at affordable prices. Currently, the company is supplying two brands of products to Pakistan Army commonly known as Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) and Emergency Pack Ration (EP Ration or high-energy biscuits) whereas a plant for the production of dehydrated vegetables and fruits is under construction,” the official website of PANA Force Foods mentions. The website also states that the processing centre provides food to civil population during natural calamities, like earthquakes and floods. According to Hindu belief, eating beef is a religious offence since the cow is a sacred animal and treated on a par with one’s mother. In Nepal — for long the world’s only Hindu state — the first royal order officially prohibiting cow slaughter stated that the punishments for the crime were death and confiscation of all property of the offender. The first Civil Code of Nepal, the Muluki Ain of 1854, stated: “This kingdom is the only kingdom in the world where cows, women, and Brahmins may not be killed.” It trumpeted Nepal as the ‘purest Hindu kingdom’ and simultaneously signaled to Nepalese citizens that Hindu religious creeds would be the law of the land. But an amendment in 1990 to the Civil Code made cow slaughter punishable by 12 years in prison. Delhi High Court raises alarm over illegal buildings . By Mail Today in New Delhi . Municipal authorities in Delhi received a rap from the Delhi High Court on Wednesday over the numerous illegal buildings across the city. Days after the killer earthquake in Nepal, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said unauthorised constructions and colonies in the city are disasters waiting to happen. A bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva observed that if an earthquake hits Delhi like the one in Nepal, all the unauthorised buildings constructed without following regulations, will crumble. It also said each government has been extending the date till which illegal constructions are protected from punitive action as it is looking for votes. “If people die, then who will vote?” the court asked. “They are disasters waiting to happen. Are you (municipal corporations) taking strict action? Are you coming out with an action plan?” the bench questioned while hearing a batch of petitions on unauthorised constructions in the city. In response, the civic agency said it was coming out with an action plan. The court, thereafter, said it will take up the matter of seismic viability of structures in the national Capital in some other appropriate matter. UK aid team in security breach at Delhi airport . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . It has come to light that a rescue team which arrived from the United Kingdom on Monday for operations in earthquake-hit Nepal, violated the safety norms of the Delhi IGI Airport. The team allegedly waited in front of an aircraft at the ‘apron area’ of the airport for about six hours before they could fly to Kathmandu. According to the members of the British rescue team, after waiting for all those hours, they were accommodated in a flight of the Spanish Air Force. Members of the British rescue team headed to Nepal posted photos of themselves waiting at IGI Airport on Twitter . According to a senior civil aviation official, it was a case of gross violation of safety rules. The DGCA can take action against the agencies that were responsible for the violation. “DGCA had earlier punished various airlines for committing such a violation. This particular British team had dogs with them and they were in front of the aircraft for six hours. It’s scary,” a senior DGCA official said after seeing the photographs of the group that were posted by a rescue team member on Twitter. An immigration official said the British group comprised 15-20 personnel from the UK Fire and Rescue team. They reached Delhi IGI Airport around 5.30pm on Monday. But due to weather and other clearance issues, they were asked to wait at the airport. “The team didn’t have proper clearances. India keeps a watch on every unit and aircraft flying to Kathmandu through Delhi. Airport officials asked them to wait but instead of going to the terminal building, these rescue team members waited in front of the nosewheel of an aircraft,” a senior airport official told Mail Today. Later, when the Indian agencies told them that the weather in Kathmandu was not favourable and it was packed with aircraft, the British rescue team members arranged their materials on their own, the official said. After almost an hour they managed to convince the Spanish Air Force officials, who agreed to fly these British rescue team members to Kathmandu. “Even then, the rescue team members didn’t go inside the airport. No security official asked them to move from there. They remained there for more than three hours,” a senior immigration official said. “They had equipment which needed to be checked by various agencies. Also, they didn’t take proper permission due to which they were asked to wait. But, they ignored all security rules and stayed there in front of an aircraft,” a senior airport official said. According to a senior official of the ministry of civil aviation: “No one is allowed to wait in front of an aircraft. Even the passengers are not allowed to put their baggage near to the plane.” The team reportedly left Delhi around 12 midnight and reached Kathmandu around 2am.","Cows are treated as sacred in Nepal, where the majority are Hindus .

135,"Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season. His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'","Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Rangers' tough run-in could mean they miss out on second place in the Scottish Championship to Hibernian .

7209,"A four-poster bed which was dumped in a hotel car park and sold for £2,200 has been verified as once belonging to King Henry VII – and it could now be worth millions. The intricately-carved ornate bed was left in the car park of the former Redland House Hotel in Hough Green, Chester, by builders who were renovating the property. Oblivious to its true value and historical significance, the construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers. The four-poster oak wood bed (above), which was dumped in the car park of Redland House Hotel in Chester and later sold at auction for £2,200, has now been confirmed by DNA as once belonging to King Henry VII . The intricately-carved bed was left in the car park of the former hotel by builders who were renovating the property and, oblivious to its true value and historical significance,  left it to be picked up by auctioneers . It was snapped up for £2,200 in 2010 by Ian Coulson, a four-poster bed specialist from Northumberland who spotted the item, which was listed as 19th-century gothic revival, on the internet. However, he was shocked when his new 'Victorian' purchase arrived and approached TV historian Jonathan Foyle with a suspicion that the bed was, in fact, the only surviving Tudor bed. Since then, Mr Foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact's historical roots and has now revealed that DNA testing on the bed's timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII. He said tests confirmed it was European oak and of a sub-species 'typical of the origin of the finest, slow-grown oak imported by the medieval elites', with analysis of the historic paintwork proving its age. 'Under the varnish, traces of late medieval decoration have been found,' he said. He has traced it back to 1495, when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lancashire to see the Stanley family, who had helped him to victory in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Mr Foyle said DNA from the bed's timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII (pictured) and he traced it back to 1495, when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lancashire.  Henry VIII may have been conceived in the bed . The bed was snapped up by Ian Coulson, a four-poster bed specialist from Northumberland, for £2,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former Redland House Hotel in Hough Green, Chester (above) TV historian Jonathan Foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact's historical roots and has now revealed that DNA testing on the bed's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to King Henry VII . He also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the Matthew Bible of 1537 - reading: 'The stinge of death is sinne. The strength of sinne is the lawe' - which was added after 1547, when England had a Protestant monarch. The carving also features biblical scenes of Henry and his wife Elizabeth of York styled as Adam and Eve, and as Jesus Christ and his mother, the Virgin Mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility, such as acorns, bunches of grapes and strawberries. Meanwhile, scribblings in a Victorian furniture restorer's diary suggested that the bed was at Lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644. Mr Foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of Victorian revivalists by reflecting on the Tudors' belief that they had been chosen by God to save England from civil war. The bed features an inscription from the Matthew Bible of 1537 - reading: 'The stinge of death is sinne. The strength of sinne is the lawe' - which was added after 1547, when England had a Protestant monarch . The bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of Henry and his wife Elizabeth of York styled as Adam and Eve, and as Jesus Christ and his mother, the Virgin Mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . He said the headboard showed Henry VII and his bride as Adam and Eve transmuted into Christ - adding: 'It's arguably the cradle of the English Reformation. Henry VIII may have been conceived in bed . The carved four-poster bed, which has been revealed as Henry VIIs, was reportedly created for the marriage of the first Tudor King and his wife, Elizabeth of York, on January 18, 1486. It is highly likely that the couple's son, Henry, was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. Born at Greenwich Palace in 1491, Henry VIII was the third child and second son of Henry VII and his wife. Only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 April, 1509. Under Henry VIII's reign, England turned in favour of Protestantism and split from Rome, the Royal Navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded France. Jonathan Foyle, chief executive of World Monuments Fund Britain, said: 'This bed belonged to Henry VIII. It has to be the most important piece of furniture [in England' - and arguably, royal artefact.' He added: 'Even the Westminster coronation chair has less to say than this.' Experts believe Henry VII may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son. 'Look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of Christ and Mary; it's Henry VIII's God complex in a nutshell.' Dr Foyle described the 15th Century artefact, which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in England, as 'a complete national treasure'. He added: 'Evidence suggests the bed was made for the Painted Chamber of Westminster Palace for the marriage ceremony at Westminster Abbey on January 18, 1486.' Mr Foyle is backed by other experts, such as Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford University, who described the rediscovery as 'exceptionally important'. The medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to £20million, although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display. It is part of the 'A Bed of Roses' exhibition at the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII's second wife, at Hever Castle in Kent which also features a portrait of Henry VIII as a young man. The bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in England. In 2013, the battle-scarred skeleton of Richard III was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in Leicester. Meanwhile, in December of the same year, archaeologists uncovered a site in the Amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of Atahualpa, the last emporer of the Incas. And last year, explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to Alfred the Great in the grounds of Hyde Abbey in Winchester. Henry VII's four-poster bed will remain on display in the Long Gallery at Hever Castle in Kent until November 22.","Four-poster bed dumped in a hotel car park and sold at auction for £2,200 .

44,"Former Queens Park Rangers chairman Gianni Paladini has registered as a director of a new Bradford City holding company in what appears to be the first move towards taking control at Valley Parade. Paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left Loftus Road in 2011 and has attempted to buy Birmingham City from Carson Yeung. The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford, a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford . Bradford's most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea . Phil Parkinson’s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter-final replay at Reading. Those FA Cup exploits came against a backdrop of colourful and passionate support. They took 8,000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club’s enormous potential, having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn, with the help of Parkinson’s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City (Holdings) Limited, set up in February. The company was originally set up with Paladini and Mauro Milanese named as directors but Milanese’s name has been removed. Paladini has previously made an attempt to buy Birmingham from Carson Yeung (pictured) Milanese is a former centre half who played for several Italian clubs and had one year at QPR during a long playing career and briefly managed Leyton Orient last year. Paladini’s ambitions to return to football are well documented. As well as trying to buy Birmingham, he has been linked possible takeovers at Millwall and Reading. Bradford were beaten 6-0 at home by Bristol City on Tuesday, which confirmed Bristol City’s promotion to the Championship and virtually ended Bradford’s hopes of capping an incredible season by reaching the play-offs. Paladini spent eight years at QPR, seizing control after a complicated takeover in 2003 and attracting investment from billionaires Lakshmi Mittal and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. He left his role at Loftus Road in 2011 following the takeover by Tony Fernandes.","Gianni Paladini has registered as director of Bradford's holding company .

10588,"Raheem Sterling arrived at Liverpool's Melwood base for training on Wednesday after the latest twist to his controversy-ridden season. Sterling has escaped a club punishment after being caught on video inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide, but fresh pictures have emerged of him holding a shisha pipe, this time alongside young team-mate Jordon Ibe. Sterling, 20, and Ibe, 19, were pictured during what is believed to be a visit to a shisha cafe in London earlier this season. The teenager was spotted arriving at Melwood on Wednesday just seconds after Sterling. Ibe was driving a black Range Rover while Sterling arrived in a white version of the same model. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling pictured arriving at training on Wednesday morning . Sterling arrived at Melwood in a white Range Rover after fresh pictures emerged of him with a shisha pipe . Jordon Ibe at Melwood on Wednesday after he was also pictured alongside Sterling holding a shisha . Sterling is expected to meet Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers on Thursday and he will be reminded of his professional responsibilities and warned about the consequences of taking a drug that has been called ‘hippy crack’. Rodgers questioned Sterling’s professionalism on Monday after footage emerged of the 20-year-old unconscious in his house in Southport having taken nitrous oxide with two unnamed friends. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. It has been a chastening week for Sterling. Pictures were published on Sunday of him smoking a shisha pipe and then a different set of images surfaced on Tuesday of Sterling and Ibe. Casually dressed, the pair are sat on a sofa in front of a table with shisha pipes, cans of fizzy Fanta orange and a portable music speaker. Ibe, wearing a red hoodie and ripped black jeans, is pictured holding a shisha pipe. He is sitting next to Sterling, who is wearing a tight white v-neck t-shirt and blue jeans, on the sofa. The pair can be seen smiling and joking as they hold on to the pipes in the bar. The pictures are believed to have been taken last September. Liverpool offered no comment on those photos. The club maintain the matter will be dealt with internally but he is not going to be fined. Sterling enraged Liverpool after saying in a BBC interview that he was ‘flattered’ to be linked with Arsenal. It is understood, however, that Arsenal have gone cold on Sterling, who scored in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday. All talks about his future have been put on hold until the end of the campaign but Ian Ayre, Liverpool’s chief executive, issued a strong line yesterday, insisting that Sterling — who has turned down a contract in the region of £100,000 per week — would be at Anfield for a ‘long time’. Ayre said: ‘Raheem’s agent has asked that we park all discussions regarding his future until the summer. We respect that. Raheem is a Liverpool player and has two years left on his contract. We expect Raheem Sterling to be here for a long time.’ It appears that Sterling and Ibe each have a shisha pipe and are also drinking Fanta . Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Shisha pipes are used to smoke fruit-flavoured tobacco, which is burned on hot coals, through a long tube. They are commonly used in the Middle East. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes, which calls into question the professionalism of any athlete using the pipe. The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: ‘Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was pictured on a social media site with the picture captioned ‘1 down 3 to go’, suggesting he did not just take a single drag on the pipe.

4922,"Diego Costa looks set to be sidelined for at least two weeks after sustaining another hamstring injury during Chelsea's 2-1 win over Stoke City. The Spain international is likely to miss Chelsea's upcoming Barclays Premier League matches against west London rivals Queens Park Rangers and Manchester United. Jose Mourinho threw Costa on at half-time after going into the interval at 1-1 following Charlie Adam's outstanding 66-yard equaliser to cancel out Eden Hazard's opener. Chelsea striker Diego Costa limped off with a hamstring injury shortly after coming on at the interval . Blues striker Costa looks despondent as he sits on the turf following another injury to his hamstring . However Costa, who replaced Blues team-mate Oscar, lasted just over 10 minutes as he pulled up with a hamstring injury. Mourinho's gamble did not prove to be too costly as Loic Remy netted his side's winning goal just five minutes after Costa limped off the Stamford Bridge pitch. The Portuguese tactician, speaking to Sky Sports after his side's win, said: 'In football we have to take risks and as a manager if we have a tough result then I have to make decisions such as bring Costa on in the game. 'All the scans they did two days ago said the muscle was clean, the image was clean and he trained 100 per cent for two days. He did more in those training sessions then he did in the game, he took lots of shots. 'The player was convinced he was ready, not for 90 minutes, but he was ready to play and to help the team. Costa looks in pain after pulling up at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 2-1 win over Stoke City . Jose Mourinho was happy to have gambled with Costa's fitness despite losing the striker after 10 minutes . 'Sometimes as a manager I have to risk things. Medical departments have to do the same, if they want to be top medical departments like our department is. 'The safe medical department cannot work with me. People with fear, afraid to risk, cannot work with me. 'My medical department is fantastic, they do fantastically well for us. 'Today between them and the player and myself, things didn't happen the best way, but I'm happy with that, because it's football."" 'If we were 2-0 or 3-0 up we planned not to use him until next week but we had to take that risk. He looks to be out for a couple of weeks minimum but I'm glad we got the points.'

9671,"A family of four was enjoying a day out together in Portland, Maine when a white man yelled a racial slur at them before speeding off. The family consisted of a black mother and a white father who were with their nine-year-old daughter and 23-year-old son. The man was in a car filled with a group of young white men when he screamed 'Hey n*****s!' at them on Friday and drove away. Several bystanders witnessed the incident, including a local news reporter for WCSH 6 and WLBZ 2, Jackie Ward. She shared her account of the story on Facebook, as a 'reminder for us to be kinder to each other.' The story has since caused a stir in Maine - shocking some residents of the state. News anchor Jackie Ward (left) shared the story of Shay Stewart-Bouley (right), a blogger who writes about race, and her family when the racial slur was shouted at them on Friday. She said she shared her account of the story as a reminder to be kinder . The mother, Shay Stewart-Bouley who runs a blog called Black Girl In Maine and writes about race, has told her story of how the incident unfolded that day. She wrote in her blog: 'As a mixed-raced family in a white space, the reality is that anytime we leave our house as a family, we risk incurring the wrath of the ignorant and hateful. 'To partake in the joys of the first treats of spring can turn ugly without notice and, sadly, a visit to Maine’s most populous city yesterday was the day when the ugly became personal and my nine-year-old daughter learned that there are people who will never know her essence but instead will reduce her to nothing more than a n*****.' Ward who was with in the Old Port when she watched the incident, and said in the moment she had become frozen and was unable to comprehend what was happening. She wrote on Facebook: 'Yesterday in the Old Port, an adorable family of four was walking down Fore Street enjoying the day, popping in and out of stores along with everyone else in downtown Portland. 'I was waiting outside of a store with my dog when they were walking on Fore Street. Suddenly, a man driving by screamed the n-word at them as he sped off. As the girl's brother chased after the car, Ward said she saw the child become visibly upset. She wrote: 'What happened next is what made me the most sad. As the dad crossed the street to see if he could see how far his son was running, the little girl started getting visibly upset with what was going on. 'But the mom remained calm and stern. She told the girl her brother is a grown man who can stand up for what he believes in. ""People are going to use that word and you need to know how to stand up for yourself."" Ward shared the story on Facebook (the post above) which went viral and prompted Stewart-Bouley to write a blog post with her account of the racist incident . After the man shouted the slur, Stewart-Bouley's son (above) ran after the car filled with anger after 'enduring such language with regularity as a grown man' his mother said . 'My heart broke for that little girl as she harshly learned how our society has such a long way to go when it comes to racism.' After sharing her post, several readers asked if anyone traced the car or got the license plate number, while others asked Ward if she took action in the moment. Stewart-Bouley wrote on Ward's post that she was upset following the incident but that was not the time and place to be emotional. 'I have lived in Maine 13 years now, I write about race and I head up an anti racism organization Community Change Inc in Boston. 'In that moment, my only concern was the safety of my children specifically my son who after spending his childhood in Maine and enduring such language with regularity as a grown man is no longer willing to have his humanity denied.' Stewart-Bouley wrote: 'I was upset but that was not the time and place to be emotional' She added in her blog post that while she was grateful for Ward's observations she was saddened that she was not comfortable enough following the exchange to come over to the family and ask if they were okay. 'Racism is a system, and that silence upholds that system even when we don’t believe we are actively creating harm,' wrote Stewart-Bouley. In a follow-up post on Sunday, Ward hit back at critics clarifying that her intentions with sharing the story was to remind people to respect one another, while addressing the questions surrounding what she did during the incident. She wrote: 'First, I'm glad so many people are talking about a real issue in Maine, but I also want to clarify a few things. 'For those people questioning my motives, I didn't share the story for personal attention or to try to stir up controversy. Stewart-Bouley wrote in her blog that she was saddened Ward did not feel comfortable enough to ask if the family was okay. Ward wrote a follow-up post on Facebook apologizing for her lack of action during the incident while clarifying her intentions . 'I was trying to make a positive out of a terrible incident by opening people's eyes to the fact that these incidents do still happen and reminding people to respect one another.' She added: 'I understand now that my inaction was hurtful to the family and for that I'm very sorry. It was not due to a lack of outrage or sympathy but simply that I didn't know whether the family would appreciate someone interjecting themselves into the situation. 'I thought that the way I could help would be by bringing awareness to it by writing about it.' As for Stewart-Bouley and her family, she said on Friday during the car ride home the mood of the day had been destroyed. She said her family was reminded that the world can be an utterly ugly place. As her daughter asked if they could move away, she told her 'ugly can live anywhere'. 'If I felt there was a place that was safe and where we could be assured that we would never hear that word again, I would move heaven and earth to get us there,' she wrote.","Jackie Ward witnessed the family of four have racial slur shouted at them while they were out for the day on Friday .

4147,"Havana, Cuba (CNN)All eyes are going to be on the new kid finally allowed to play and the big kid who for so long wanted nothing to do with him -- Cuba and the United States in the same diplomatic playground. Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by marshaling the support of other regional countries to insist on their attendance at the Summit of the Americas. And for the first time since 1962, the U.S. has not blocked Cuba's attempt to join. Now it's time to see how they play and who they play with -- especially Venezuela, which often falls out with Washington for crushing dissent at home and supplying Havana with billions of dollars in oil. Cuba is trying to re-establish itself at the two-day summit in Panama, arriving with more than 100 government officials, diplomats, small business people and artists. But Cuba's attempts to rebrand itself as an open, diverse society stumbled Wednesday when government supporters and anti-Castro supporters brawled in the streets of Panama. Video of the incident showed Cuban government officials exchanging punches and insults with dissidents until Panamanian police in riot gear broke up the melee. With the historic thawing in relations between the U.S. and Cuba, Washington now has urgent business to discuss with Havana. ""We have really big issues with the Cubans that do need to be solved,"" said Ambassador Vicki Huddleston, who served as the chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. She added ""The Cubans are typical of their negotiating style. You think it's going to be easy because we have said 'We are going to have good relations with you' and they say, 'That's not exciting for us and it is for you.' So they are hard negotiators as they always have been."" The forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations. While President Barack Obama is not scheduled to meet Cuban leader Raul Castro, U.S. officials said there will be opportunities for ""interaction"" between the two leaders. The first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at Nelson Mandela's funeral. Their brief handshake captured the world's attention and lit up social media. Few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked Cold War-era relations. Obama had said he had hoped a U.S. Embassy would reopen in Havana before the summit, but Cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department list of countries that support terrorism. ""It would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while Cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism,"" said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and lead negotiator in the talks. Cuba was added to the list in 1982, which includes Syria, Iran and Sudan. The designation carries financial sanctions which Cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy. The State Department has sent a recommendation to the White House that Cuba be removed, paving the way for the White House to announce its intent to de-list Cuba as early as this week, two administration officials told CNN. Removal from the list ""does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system, or its foreign policy,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. ""It's a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism."" Rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on Venezuela, saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the United States, despite a recent declaration to that effect. The designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials, but it ignited a firestorm, particularly in Cuba, which has close ties to Venezuela. Deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was a friend and admirer of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez's successor Nicolas Maduro continues to send Cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day, despite his country's own economic turmoil. In exchange, Cuba sends doctors, military advisers and sports trainers to Venezuela. In Cuba's state-run media, criticism of U.S. policy towards Venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations. In March, Fidel Castro published a letter criticizing the U.S.' ""brutal plans towards"" Venezuela and the Cuban government promised ""unconditional aid"" to help defend against American threats. Its remains to be seen how much Cuba will risk its warming relations with the United States to back up ally Venezuela. But apparently there is little doubt among the Cuban people on what their government should do. A poll of 1,200 Cubans released on Wednesday found that 97% of the people surveyed by Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision Noticias/Fusion supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations.","Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by gaining attendance at Summit of the Americas .

11269,"Keith Anderson attacked two men who he asked for a cigarette last year. He left one, an Army Lance Corporal, in a coma and severely brain damaged . A violent thug who ended a soldier's career with one punch because he wasn't given a cigarette has been jailed for seven years. Lance Corporal Albert Duffy had survived bomb blasts during a glittering military career which saw him complete three tours of war-ravaged Afghanistan. But after returning home to the UK, he was attacked at a bus stop by drink and drug-crazed Keith Anderson and left with severe brain damage. Just minutes before the attack, Anderson had punched another man, injuring him and leaving him incapable of work for a month. The 28-year-old thug 'bounced around, triumphantly like a boxer' after the assaults, a court heard this week. A judge was told the soldier had high hopes of progressing through the ranks, but is now unlikely to return to the military. Jailing Anderson for seven years at Teesside Crown Court this week, Recorder Patrick Palmer said: 'Albert Duffy was enjoying his career in the army. 'He was doing his bit for the United Kingdom and served abroad and served in combat and it seems highly unlikely he will return to his career. Your one punch destroyed that.' The court heard Anderson first attacked Adam Crosby at a bus stop in Hartlepool town centre on July 26 last year. He was angered that he only offered him the remainder of the cigarette he was smoking. Mr Crosby had to take a month off work at his family firm after he was left with a fractured cheek bone and damage to his teeth and nose. Anderson then walked to a nearby bus stop where L/Cpl Duffy was waiting and punched him to the ground after he failed to produce a cigarette. The soldier was left him slumped on the ground, bleeding from his ears and in a coma for 14 days. He sustained a fractured skull and needed two rounds of surgery after suffering haemorrhages, with part of his brain being removed. L/Cpl Duffy, from Darlington, County Durham, was a member of the 3 Rifles Infantry Battalion and had served in the Army for more than ten years, seeing colleagues killed and injured in Afghanistan. Teesside Crown Court heard Lance Corporal Albert Duffy's military career had been ruined by the attack . He escaped with his life in 2009 after a vehicle he was in hit an improvised explosive device. He was blown 15 feet into the air, but suffered only a broken foot. Since the attack, he has gone from one of the fittest in his battalion to a man who struggles to put together sentences, the court heard. He also has hearing problems and has little short-term memory, the judge was told. His mother, Marie Briggs, says she no longer recognises him as the caring son once looked up to by his seven siblings and her three-step children. In a statement to the court, L/Cpl Duffy said: 'I don't know what I'll do if I don't have the Army in my life and I have fought for my country. 'I find it difficult to comprehend how my life has been ruined by a male from Hartlepool, who punched me for no reason.' Fellow-victim Mr Crosby told the court: 'I'm 25, I should be enjoying myself, but this attack has had a massive affect on me.' Robin Turton, prosecuting, said when Anderson was arrested on July 30, he asked police: 'Is that me you're looking for in the paper' after seeing headlines as officers appealed for help. He also asked about the condition of one of the victims, but made no comment when he was interviewed. L/Cpl Duffy and the other victim, Adam Crosby, were set upon at a bus stop in Hartlepool in July last year . Mr Crosby's blood was found on clothing seized from Anderson's home in Hartlepool. Anderson admitted grievous bodily harm against Mr Crosby and grievous bodily harm with intent for the attack on L/Cpl Duffy. He was sentenced to two years for the attack on Mr Crosby and seven for the assault on L/Clp Duffy to run concurrently. Neil Mullarkey, mitigating, said Anderson had started to tackle his drink problem since he was remanded in custody. He added: 'He is disgusted with himself and thinks about what he has done every day and is ashamed.' The court heard that Anderson already has 19 convictions for 39 offences, including punching and head butting two women in a takeaway and an assault in which he used a pool ball in a sock to attack a man in a pub. But Recorder Mr Palmer stopped short of classifying him as a 'dangerous offender', which would have allowed the judge to jail Anderson indefinitely.","Soldier survived bomb blast in Afghanistan during 10-year Army career .

1743,"Francis Coquelin is determined to take his chance at Arsenal and claims he wants to follow in the footsteps of club legend Patrick Vieira. The Frenchman has thrived in the centre of Arsenal's midfield since returning from loan at Championship side Charlton earlier in the season to earn plaudits for his robust performances. Vieira was captain during Arsenal's trophy laden beginning to Arsene Wenger's reign and Coquelin hopes he can keep performing to emulate the club legend. Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin, who has become an integral part of their midfield, celebrates with fans . 'I’m not going to say to you I am (the new Vieira), obviously I want to be but I think it’s down to the performance I put in every week so I’m just trying to give me best every game so hopefully I can do that in the long term,' Coquelin told BT Sport. On loan at Charlton, the 23-year-old feared he may not play for the Gunners again. 'Well, obviously that was in my head and I think at the time my loan had finished the first month. I could see the injuries over there, I think Arteta was out, Ramsey and it was the time for me to either extend my loan or come back and I extended it and thought maybe I won’t get the chance now,' added Coquelin. The midfielder is determined to prove himself at Arsenal and hold down his place in the starting XI. The 23-year-old is not shy of putting in a robust challenge on opponents as he adds steel to Arsenal's midfield . 'I always had confidence in myself and belief in myself I just need the chance. I got the chance because other people got injured and tried to grab it with both hands and do as well as I could,' he told BT Sport. Arsenal have been much maligned in recent seasons for lacking grit and strength in the centre of the park, but Coquelin is happy to focus on the defensive side of the game. 'The way I think is that I’m just trying to do what’s best for the team. There are other players who can do this job and I’m trying to focus on mine which is to get the ball back and help the team defensively,' added the 23-year-old. Coquelin, tackling Manchester City's David Silva, has managed to establish a starting place in the Arsenal XI . 'Obviously sometimes you want to get involved a little bit more because we play great football and this is Arsenal, you always want to get involved moving forward. But you need to think about the defensive aspect and that is what my job is all about.' Arsene Wenger's side have been in top form in the Premier League, winning their last six matches to close the gap on Manchester City in second and establish a place in the prestigious top four. The Gunners take on Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday in a pivotal clash in the race for Champions League football, but Arsenal's 'new Vieira' is confident. 'We obviously want to win this game you know, it’s a massive one, really important and we can increase the gap to nine points if we win so yes, I think it’s really important,' said the Frenchman. 'I can’t say definitely because mathematically it won’t be over, so I can’t say that, but yes we see a lot of confidence in us because over the last few months we have had some big results and if we can beat Liverpool it will be another massive one.' Coquelin celebrates with countryman Olivier Giroud as Arsenal managed to win every game in March . See the full interview with Francis Coquelin on ‘Matchday Live with Fletch & Sav’ from 10am this Saturday on BT Sport 1. Guests include Ian Wright, Harry Redknapp, Piers Morgan and Michael Owen.","The 23-year-old has become an integral part of Arsenal's starting XI .

On the table the five-time world champion enjoyed a successful day, firing two rapid centuries in establishing a 12-4 lead, needing just one more in Monday's closing session to the match to reach the quarter-finals.

6500,"Real estate heir and suspected murderer Robert Durst has sent a bizarre letter to a reporter that shares no details about his alleged crime, but observations about life in Los Angeles. Molly Hennessey-Fiske, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who has been covering proceedings against Durst, 71, after his mid-March arrest in Louisiana, received a letter purporting to have been written by the suspect in state prison. The letter, post-marked April 1st in Baton Rouge, specifically states that Durst 'said nothing about charges, crimes or trials' but rambles on about Durst's thoughts on life in southern California. Dick DeGuerin, Durst's lead attorney, said that the letter looked like his client's handwriting. Murder suspect Robert Durst has sent a bizarre letter, in which he mentions his taste for opera and pro football, to a Los Angeles Times reporter covering his case. Molly Hennessey-Fiske received the letter, which was addressed 'Hiya Holly' from a man purporting to be Robert Durst at a Louisiana state prison . Durst, who was arrested for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman last month, pleaded not guilty to weapons charges on Thursday. Above, he is escorted to prison after his arraignment on March 17 . Hennessey-Fiske, a veteran reporter for the West Coast newspaper, is the outlet's Houston bureau chief and has been covering Durst's legal proceeding . 'Bob is his own person and he’s writing letters to people. As long as they’re not discussing the facts or legal plans or strategy, I don’t have any problem with it,' Mr DeGuerin told The Los Angeles Times. Durst, who was heir to a vast real estate empire before becoming estranged from his family, was arrested last month for the suspected 2000 murder of his friend, writer Susan Berman, in Los Angeles. His letter to Hennessey-Fiske, her paper's Houston bureau chief, does not speak about on his impending extradition to California, but touches on various topics of conversation related to Los Angeles. In sloppy handwritten text with grammar mistakes, Durst spoke about places he lived in the city 'part-time' from 2008 to 2011. He said he 'hated LA traffic, which makes Houston look like a small town' before going on to say that his interests are 'opera and pro football'. Durst began the letter with an apparent mixing up of Hennesey-Fiske's first name by writing 'Hiya Holly'. Hiya Holly, . I used to read your biline, from 2008-2011 I lived part time in L.A., I had a great apt in 1100 Alta Loma and I had bought a great apt complex on Brynhurst. Sareb Kaufman was my broker. I loved watching the traffic come up La Cienaga and mush into Santa Monica, hated L.A. traffic which makes Houston seem like a small town. Used to breakfast at coffee whatever on Sunset. My interests are opera and pro football. Your politicos and business leaders have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree and there was no football. Like L.A. Opera except for Wagner's ring cycle with the absurd costumes and sloped stage, a true example of Hollywood gone berserk. As my minor balance prb. expanded to full blown hydrocephalus, requiring a shunt. I knew if I was going to let some guy drill into my head, there was no place I would be willing to go ahead other than the Houston Medical Center and I left L.A. I have said nothing about charges, crimes or trials. If you decide to used any of this, which is OK, please make the above clear. I am sure you know what your abilities are to visit me when I get to L.A., which is, if any of this gets published, please copy me . Bob . (Grammar and spelling errors throughout) Durst (right) was long thought to be involved in the murder of his friend and confidante Susan Berman (left) before his arrest. He is currently state and federal gun charges before being extradited to California . He blamed the lack of football in LA on 'politicos and business leaders' who 'have chosen to fight rather than agree to disagree'. The suspect said that he liked the L.A. Opera, with the exception of 19th century German composer Richard Wagner's The Ring Cycle, a 15-hour, three part show based on Norse legend. Durst said that he disliked the 'absurd costumes and sloped stage, a true example of Hollywood gone berserk'. The letter also gives information about the elderly man's health, and said that he moved from California to Texas to 'let some guy drill into my head' during surgery for what he says is hydrocephalus, water on the brain. Last year Durst had a shunt on the his head to drain water. Handwriting, including that on a 2000 letter to Beverly Hills Police informing them about the dead body of Susan Berman, is expected to play a part in the case against Durst for the murder of his friend . Evidence that came to light during the filming of HBO's The Jinx shows similar handwriting to the 'cadaver' letter on an envelope sent to Berman before her death (left). Right, another sample of his letter-writing . He also asked to be 'copied' if any of the information from his letter to Hennessey-Fiske was published. The millionaire, who gained $65 million from a court settlement with his family over his inheritance, was arrested in mid-March at a hotel in New Orleans after leaving his home in Houston. His life and criminal trials have gained more attention after he was the subject of an HBO documentary series called The Jinx, which delved into the Berman killing as well as two other deaths to which he is connected. Many observers think that the heir also played a role in the disappearance of his wife Kathleen McCormack in 1982 and have speculated that he killed his confidante Berman so that she did not reveal any information to police. He was found not guilty in 2003 of killing a man who was his neighbor at Galveston, Texas, house where Durst was living and pretending to be a mute woman named Dorothy Ciner. The HBO documentary series The Jinx delved into a letter Durst wrote to Berman obtained by the victim's stepson Sareb Kaufman . Durst, seen with The Jinx director Andrew Jarecki, willingly participated in the series, though he was later caught telling himself that he killed all the people he is accused of murdering . Durst admitted to chopping up the body of the Texas man, Morris Black, and dumping into Galveston Bay, but said the killing was in self-defense. The Jinx captured footage of Durst allegedly admitting to himself that he killed all three people while wearing a still-live microphone. 'Killed them all,' he said while in the bathroom after an interview. Durst was recently indicted on weapons charges for the revolver found in his New Orleans hotel room, a development that will most likely delay his extradition to California for the Berman trial. He is currently staying in the mental ward of state prison and is being held without bail. As a convicted felon he is barred from owning a gun in Louisiana, but pleaded not guilty to the charges on Thursday. He is also charged with having a gun while in possession of five ounces marijuana and faces up to 30 years in prison in addition to federal firearms charges. The arrest in the Berman case, in which Durst was long thought to have played a part, came after new evidence from the victim's stepson was shown as part of the HBO series. The final episode of the Jinx ran the day after Durst was arrested. Durst (right) is also thought to have been involved in the disappearance of his first wife Kathleen McCormack (right) and admitted to killing Morris Black (left) but said it was in self-defense . Durst's lawyer Dick DeGuerin (pictured in March) said that he does not mind his client sending letters from prison as long as they don't give away legal strategy . An episode also focused on a letter to Berman from Durst obtained by Berman's stepson Sareb Kaufman, where the handwriting matched a message to police alerting them of the writer's death. Initial Los Angeles Police investigations into the 'cadaver' letter believed that Berman's manager Nyle Brenner wrote the message, according to the New York Daily News. However the handwriting matches the letter from Kaufman, who is mentioned in Durst's recent letter to Hennessey-Fiske as his broker for an apartment deal, and contained the same spelling mistake of Beverly Hills as 'Beverley Hills'. Durst's lawyer Mr DeGuerin told the Los Angeles Times that the handwriting appeared authentic, but  'It certainly doesn’t look like the cadaver letter'. The similarities between Durst's previous correspondence and the anonymous letter sent to the Beverly Hills police is expected to play a role in his trial in California. Durst ends his letter to Hennessey-Fiske by saying that she is probably aware of her ability to visit him once he returns to Los Angeles.","Molly Hennessey-Fiske, Los Angeles Times reporter, received letter .

8580,"The family of a man who was cremated by mistake after a funeral home accidentally put a stranger's body in his coffin have filed a lawsuit. Jerry Moon's family only discovered the devastating blunder when they opened the casket to say their final goodbyes and found the other body wrapped in a plastic bag. While the body of the loving father - who was terrified of cremation - was accidentally incinerated at Dahl McVicker Funeral Home in Kelso, Washington State. The family of Jerry Moon, pictured with his wife Janice, were distraught when they found another man's body in his coffin . A lawsuit filed by the family claims the Brown Mortuary put the body of 97-year-old Robert Petitclerc in the coffin by mistake . The family is now seeking unspecified damages for emotional distress. Chronically ill in his final years, Mr Moon began arranging for his funeral 16 years before his death in 2013. The 72-year-old railroad conductor had paid $4,655 to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis, Washington, according to a lawsuit filed in Lewis County Superior Court. The prepaid services also included embalming, a funeral and a graveside service. After he passed away at a hospice in Longview on October 13, the funeral home was responsible for transporting his body to the Brown Mortuary for a burial. But Shawn Briggs, an attorney representing Moon's family, said his identification bracelet had been placed on another body. Jerry Moon, pictured with at Weyerhaeuser Railroad where he worked for 28 years, was chronically ill in his final years and had began arranging for his funeral 16 years before his death in 2013 . Born in Chehalis, Mr Moon, a father and stepfather to six, spent most of his life in Southwest Washington . According to family members, Mr Moon's funeral was a touching goodbye to the man they loved. At the end of the service, they opened the casket. But they were horrified to find the body of Robert Petitclerc - dressed in Jerry Moon's clothes and with a picture of Moon's wife tucked under the pillow in the coffin. Plastic had been wrapped round his head and face. 'This makes me feel like he was treated as a number, not a person,' daughter Cheryl Moon told KIROTV.com at the time. 'I turned around and said to myself three times, 'That's not him, that's not him, that's not him,' son Randy Moon told the station. The mistake is all the more surprising as Mr Moon was 72 and bald while Mr Petitclerc was 97 and had a full head of hair, the lawsuit said. 'It was horrifying,' Mr Briggs told the Seattle Pi. The family, who had been given a bill of $8,834 by Brown Mortuary for the service, would only later learn that the mix up at the funeral home meant Mr Moon's had been cremated. Mr Moon, pictured with wife Janice, had paid $4,655 to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis, Washington, according to a lawsuit filed in Lewis County Superior Court . Grieving: Moon's son Randy says he believes his father is in Heaven, regardless of who was in the casket . Sadly the discovery was even more upsetting for the family as Mr Moon had always been scared of cremation. 'He was afraid of cremation,' Mr Briggs added. 'He had religious beliefs that were inconsistent with cremation.' Born in Chehalis, Mr Moon, a father and stepfather to six, had spent most of his life in Southwest Washington. Brown Mortuary initially claimed the body was Mr Moon, but later admitted he had been cremated on October 17, 2013, by mistake, according to the lawsuit. The mortuary later sent a $92.72 refund check to Janice Moon. Relatives have now filed a lawsuit against the two mortuaries that mishandled Mr Moon's remains. It says the mortuary acted fraudulently and with malice in its handling of Jerry Moon's body and conspired to cover-up the fact that Mr Moon had been mistakenly cremated. The mortuary is part of a funeral service chain owned by Texas-based Service Corporation International. Representative Kim Tarleton declined to comment on the allegations, saying it would be 'inappropriate to share any details about this situation.'","Jerry Moon, 72, had pre-arranged to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis .

10764,"(CNN)Every week in the heart of Nima, a slum in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, families congregate at a local mosque. When the time comes, young girls say goodbye to their loved ones and part ways, filing up concrete steps leading up to the floor above. There, inside a large room dotted with brown tables, rows of flashing computer screens await for them. ""When the parents are praying [downstairs], we are teaching the girls upstairs,"" explains tech entrepreneur Regina Agyare, who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code. Agyare's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project Achievers Ghana -- was in January 2014. This was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative ""Tech Needs Girls"" -- however, the students proved quite a draw. ""I fell in love with them, so I decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions,"" says Agyare, founder of software development company Soronko Solutions. More importantly, continues Agyare, it offered the opportunity to show ""the community the value of educating girls."" A predominantly Muslim area in a largely Christian nation, Nima has one of the densest populations in Accra. Agyare says life is often challenging for many  local girls, with some growing up without ever leaving the community. ""Girls were being forced to marry early; [denied] their right to go to school. Most of their dreams and aspirations were limited to just what was around them. ""I was shocked... I thought we had progressed as a nation. I thought we had gone past that."" This, in part, was why Agyare lent her support to Achievers Ghana. Set up by local Amadu Mohammad, the non-profit organization supports 250 girls between the age of six and 18, priming them for formal education through extracurricular classes in reading, math, poetry and information technology. Its goal is to break through social barriers and provide Nima with a generation of female role models, and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future. The project was bequeathed its classroom above the mosque it shares a building with, and Agyare says the two work closely together. Achievers Ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives, but when the mosque's chief imam Sheik Hussein Abdul Rahman championed Mohammad's vision, few maintained their reservations. Now, with parents paying a nominal fee towards the running of the organization, it is in everyone's interest that the girls succeed. Fourteen months after her first visit, Agyare's coding class is well established. She has set up a mentor scheme as part of ""Tech Needs Girls,"" recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in Nima. In each class, around 50 girls are taught HTML and run a blog called ""Slum Voices"". ""I definitely feel [technology] has given them more of a voice,"" Agyare says. ""I feel like it's allowed them to express themselves and interact with others... for them, it's important to be heard."" Some girls had never used a computer before the classes began, but Agyare's even-handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard. Agyare insists that ""we don't leave anyone behind."" To that end, a few young male faces have found their way into her classroom. This was an accidental revelation, according to Agyare. She details the story of one affronted boy. ""He wrote that he didn't like it when he saw girls learning about computers... it was difficult [for him] to see girls being empowered; he wasn't used to that."" Agyare realized that by integrating genders in her classroom she could begin to confront gender expectations. For many boys the role of a girl is ""to be their wife,"" Agyare explains, ""and she needs to be taken care of."" However, by running mixed classes boys from an early age ""can learn to see a woman as a contributing person [within society]."" Now the hope is that many of the young students will be able to go to university -- and Achievers Ghana is working on a scholarship program to make the prospect attainable. Agyare says the goal is not to turn every girl into software developers but to enable them to ""use technology in whatever field they find themselves."" She adds: ""It would be great if we had some girls that decided to go on and study computer science, but really it's about helping them reach their full potential ... and bring change to the community.""

1565,"In a matter of moments, Samantha Rawcliffe was catapulted towards an uncertain future. Without warning, the mother-of-two lost all control of her body while she was behind the wheel of her car. Gripped by what would later be diagnosed as a rare brain disorder, the 40-year-old crashed. She blamed her uncontrollable shaking in the aftermath of the accident on her shock. But over the following days, when she lost control of her bladder repeatedly, she feared something else was to blame. Tests revealed she was suffering functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term for a wide variety of neurological symptoms that doctors cannot explain. Samantha Rawcliffe, 40, from Morecambe, has been diagnosed with the rare condition functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term to cover a range of neurological symptoms . The mother-of-two suddenly lost all control of her body and crashed her car last May. In the days after the accident she lost control of her bladder and was shaking uncontrollably . 'It wasn't a bad accident, but I went home shaken and had a drink,' she said. 'I just couldn't stop shaking. 'The next day I wet myself and I wet the bed for the next three nights. 'But I didn't know what was wrong with me, and thought I had a trapped nerve or something like that. 'Even a year on, I have no feeling in my bladder, and I don't know when I need the toilet or even when I am actually weeing. 'There is no sign that will ever return. 'When I was told I had FND, I didn't even know what  it was and it just isn't out there, it's so rare.' Following her accident on May 26, last year, Mrs Rawcliffe was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital to meet neurologists. They eventually diagnosed the rare illness functional neurological disorder in September, following a series of tests. Last September doctors diagnosed the rare brain disorder. Mrs Rawcliffe is now confined to her house, unable to walk and relies on a mobility scooter. Each day she has to take a cocktail of 32 different drugs . Mrs Rawcliffe, from Morecambe, has since had to give up her job as a teaching assistant, and can no longer drive. She struggles to walk further than eight metres, and relies on a mobility scooter to get around. Functional neurological disorder is an umbrella term that covers a variety of symptoms that cannot be explained. The condition can be as debilitating as Parkinson's disease and MS, and may share many common symptoms. Very few effective treatment plans exist. Physical therapy is often the most effective form of treatment, with the aim of reintroducing proper movement and motor control. Many patients are also prescribed cognitive behaviour therapy. The condition can cause the following symptoms: . Source: FND Hope . The 40-year-old spends most of her time confined to her home, and has to take 32 tablets each day to prevent choking fits and tremors. 'Life is quite boring and I can't do anything myself whether it's washing, showering, cooking cleaning,' she said. 'Before I was diagnosed I was going to the gym five times a week and I loved my job. I'm 40 - I never wanted to retire. 'In fact, I get quite tearful when I think about it and my old colleagues always say there is a hole where Sam should be at work. 'I've got no independence anymore and I sold my car in the end because I was sick of looking at it.' Doctors cannot determine whether the condition had been lying dormant in Mrs Rawcliffe's body before it revealed itself. She suffered a mini-stroke as a teenager but recovered within three weeks and met her husband Phillip a few months later. Despite back pain from another car accident 12 years ago, the mother-of-two has not suffered any other ailments. Power plant technician Phillip, 47, and the couple's children Rhys, 19 and Rebecca, 17, have rallied to help. 'I think the kids took it hard at first - there was a lot of crying,' Mrs Rawcliffe said. 'But I have a big family and support network and they have all adapted so brilliantly. 'I used to be the life and soul of the party and I've never been a miserable person but there is so much that I can't do and it's hard to take. 'I end up kind of mourning for the life that I had had before this.' Mrs Rawcliffe is hoping to raise awareness of the condition by drumming up funds for the organisation FND Hope to help boost support for sufferers.

Anderson and the England players are put through their paces as they sprint up a hill . ‘I’ve never forgotten the sitting on the sidelines for 18 months or two years and not being able to be out there doing what I love,’ said Anderson. ‘Obviously I was playing county cricket, which was great, but the ultimate is playing for England and I want to do that for as long as possible. ‘I got off to a good start to my career but then had a few years out of the England side with dodgy form and injuries. I didn’t know if I’d ever play again. 'Those were the low periods but I had experienced Test cricket and seen how amazing it was and that determination to play again has driven me on. Once I got my chance again — I think it was 2007 or 2008 — I didn’t want to let it go again.’ Anderson celebrates after taking a wicket during the warm-up match against St Kitts & Nevis earlier this week .

4925,"An American college student who abandoned the west to wage holy war in Syria and call for homegrown attacks in the United States has told how she lied to her family and cashed in her tuition money to flee the West. Hoda Muthana, 20, spoke out about her decision to ditch her life as a college student in Hoover, Alabama, after being persuaded by terrorists that it was her duty as a Muslim. Now the radicalized former student has called for drive-by shootings  in America on Memorial Day and for blood to be spilled. Mu Muthana, who lived with her moderate Muslim family until she fled to Raqqa, Syria, revealed her path to terror in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Scroll down for video . Hoover to Raqqa: Hoda Muthana, 20, told how she abandoned her home in Alabama to be a jihadist in Syria. She is pictured left in her 2013 high school graduation photo. Pictured right are female jihadis waving the ISIS flag from a deactivated Twitter account believed to be connected to her . Fled: Muthana, pictured right in a 2011 taken at her school, said she feels all true Muslims must join ISIS . Suhan Rahman, Muthana's ISIS husband, was an Australian jihadi who was killed last month fighting for the terror group . She told reporter Ellie Hall that she conspired for months with other jihadists to hatch a plan to flee her parents, who kept a strict watch over her and her sister. Muthana was not named in full by Buzzfeed, but her identity was revealed on Monday by the Birmingham News. After a year of planning, she fled in November, spending money meant for college tuition on a flight to Turkey. From there she fled to Syria and, after a month, married an Australian jihadist, Suhan Abdul Rahman who was reportedly since been killed in an airstrike by the Jordanian military. Despite pleas from her family to come home, Muthana is resolute and claims it is the duty of all true Muslims to join her and wage war on the West. Her father told BuzzFeed: 'I believe she been brainwashed. She’s not that kind of girl. They brainwashed her.' During the interview, Muthana revealed how she escaped her strict family, who normally keep a close eye on both their daughters. Unexpected: Muthana is pictured with her classmates to the right in this yearbook photo from 2012 . Student: Muthana studied business at the University of Alabama's campus in Birmingham. She dropped courses at the school and spent the refund money traveling to ISIS-controlled territory . She said she enrolled on extra courses at the University of Alabama, where she studied business, then promptly dropped them to cash in the refund checks. Eventually she persuaded her family to let her go to Atlanta, Georgia, for the day for a field trip - which they would usually be reluctant to do. On the day of the trip she said she had caught the wrong bus home and was stuck in the city - which is when she caught her flight to the Middle East. Her panicked family went to look for her, but soon got a follow-up call from Muthana, then in Turkey, revealing her scheme to leave. According to a high school friend who spoke to the Birmingham News, Muthana was a 'quiet' girl 'who kept to herself'. Jordan LaPorta, who went to Hoover High School with her until they graduated in 2013, added: 'I don't think anybody saw this in her.' Muthana herself confessed that she had given up on all her American friends by the time she decided to leave . Sweet home? Raqqa, Muthana's new home city, is pictured above. It is the target of regular airstrikes, one of which killed Muthana's husband . 'Quiet': Shocked contemporaries of Muthana, who studied with her at Hoover High School, spoke out when her voyage to Syria was revealed . Instead, she conferred with jihadists online, and posted messages inciting fellow American Muslims to murder their countrymen. In one Tweet from a now-deactivated account with the title Umm Jihadi, she wrote: 'You have much to do while you live under our greatest enemy, enough of your sleeping! 'Go on drive-bys and spill all of their blood, or rent a big truck and drive all over them. Veterans, Patriot, Memorial etc Day parades..go on drive by's + spill all of their blood or rent a big truck n drive all over them. Kill them.' [sic] . Her family noticed her increased devotion to her religion, but assumed she was simply becoming a more ardent follower of the peaceful strain of the religion which they observe. As Muthana observed: 'They liked the change until they saw me getting ""jihadi"".' According to Muthana's father, the FBI is investigating his daughter - but the agency said its policy is not to confirm or deny any activity.","Hoda Muthana, 20, left Hoover, Alabama, to join extremists in Raqqa, Syria .

The contraceptive is made with hydrogel, a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue. The groundbreaking design will eventually offer functions like self-lubrication, topical drug delivery, and even electric conductivity, dramatically changing the capacity of male contraception, reports Science Alert. Scientists from the University of Wollongong are designing ultra-durable condoms they claim could feel even better than nothing at all . The contraceptive is made with hydrogel, a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue . The Australian team behind the design, led by materials scientist Robert Gorkin, won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013, giving them access to US$100,000 to use on research. 'Our original idea was just to try to prove that an original material could replace latex,' Mr Gorkin said. 'We were starting from scratch, we had an idea that these new materials would have the same properties as rubber with a nicer feel, but we weren't sure if they had the right properties for a condom.' 'The early indications are that the materials are strong enough and actually do prevent against the transfer of small biological molecules,' he said. Robert Gorkin, the leader of the research team responsible for the design, said: 'If you make them so pleasurable that people can't wait to put them on, then more people will use them' The team won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013, giving them access to US$100,000 to use on research . Hydrogel has been around for decades, but it has risen to prominence in recent years, after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels. The researchers now plan to partner with Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne to conduct biometric testing to measure the bodies response to the material. 'We'll be able to look at brain activity to see whether it really feels better than latex,' said Gorkin. 'If you make them so pleasurable that people can't wait to put them on, then more people will use them, and we can hopefully stop the spread of disease. It's as simple as that.' Hydrogel (pictured) has been around for decades, but it has risen to prominence in recent years, after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels . The researchers plan to conduct biometric testing to measure the bodies response to the material . Gorkin is hoping to design the product to accommodate for the around the cultural and social needs for birth control. 'It's a branding exercise as much as a scientific one,' said Gorkin. 'A material alone can't change the way we look at sex, but we believe it can definitely help.'","The design comes from scientists at the University of Wollongong .

3333,"In a beautiful new campaign for Vans and & Other Stories, the woman dubbed the 'world's oldest supermodel' has put her younger counterparts to shame. Looking radiant, Daphne Selfe, 86, shows off the collaboration between the footwear super-brand and the ethereal high street store with uncompromising grace. Daphne said of the collection, in which she appears with 22-year-old Flo Dron: 'The & Other Stories’ collection that is featured in this story is truly relaxed and timeless with a modern twist, all in lovely colours.' 86-year-old Daphne Selfe has starred in the campaign for Vans and & Other Stories alongside Flo Dunn, 22 . The images show the new footwear which sees Stories make a twist on the classic vans slip on. The shoes are then worn with pieces from the brands SS2015 collection. Daphne's career originally began  in 1949 and she once told the Express: 'Modelling was respectable then so my parents were very happy for me to do it and it was fabulous. 'I still think the Fifties was the best time to be a model because the clothes were so lovely. Of course we were much more innocent. 'There was no television, only the radio and we'd never heard of drugs.' At the time of the interview in 2011 Daphne, from Baldock, Hertfordshire, was still commanding £1,000 per day for her work. Daphne looks cool and relaxed as she models the & Other Stories collection alongside the customised shoes . 'That rate is quite rare but it's very nice when it comes and helps the pension,' she said. The model also comes from a time when it was OK to not be super skinny: 'I'm a big-boned person and back in 1950 I was 10st 7lb, although nobody told me to lose weight. 'I didn't do anything to make myself thin but once I had three children I lost weight and now I'm 8st. 'My waist is 28'' so I can sometimes get into a size eight on a shoot but I wear a 10 for comfort. I think it's ridiculous and very sad that some of the models now have become so skeletal.' Flo and Daphne sit side by side as they model almost matching outfits for the two brands . Daphne wears a day time look with lace up vans (left) changing into a red dress for another picture (right) The model has never had any surgery and shies away from botox. She once said: 'I’ve never had anything done to my face. 'Not that poison [botox], not a facelift. I think it’s a waste of money. Anyway, I couldn’t afford it!’ She previously revealed to the MailOnline that she posed nude back in the day for artists such as Barbara Hepworth. The outfits chosen for the campaign look great no matter what age the model is . She revealed that she keeps her grey hair, which is brushed down around her shoulders in the new campaign, long because it is cheaper. She said: 'My hair is long now because it’s cheaper, I don’t have to do anything, but put it in a topknot or a French pleat. 'It avoids that old lady permed look, lengthens the neck and lifts the face. I’ve got so many friends who don’t touch the make-up pot. You should keep looking nice, it makes you feel so much better.’ In modelling shots taken from the earlier part of her career Daphne shows off her effortless grace . Daphne is known for her timeless beauty and has previously admitted to never having had any surgery . Daphne took part in the Dare To Wear campaign in 2014 for the Trafford Center in Manchester . Over the last few years Daphne has landed a number of campaigns with well known brands. In 2013 she was chosen to work for TK Maxx and last year she fronted the Dare To Wear campaign for the Trafford Center in Manchester. Daphne says that she has good genes and maintains a healthy lifestyle: 'My parents gave me good genes and health, and I have always eaten sensibly. 'I was brought up through the war so the phrase ""make do and mend"" has never done me any harm. I always try to make the best of everything, to stay positive and to have a healthy lifestyle.'

9664,"There is an image of Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola deep in conversation during a Barcelona training session that did the rounds on social media a few years ago. Mourinho was Bobby Robson’s assistant at Barcelona and Guardiola was in his final years as a player at the Camp Nou at the time.

No sooner had Luis Enrique joined Barcelona at the start of this season and the photo libraries threw up an even better shot – one of Luis Enrique, Pep and Jose in their time at Barcelona. Then the archive scanners began to notice something about some of the other faces in the pictures from this era – isn’t that current PSG coach Laurent Blanc? And isn’t that current Porto coach Julen Lopetegui? And aren’t four of the coaches of the last eight in this season’s Champions League from the same club at the same time?

Blanc was a huge part of the Barcelona XI that won the Spanish Super Cup under Bobby Robson in 1996 . Luis Enrique comes face to with Blanc in the Parc des Princes stadium on Wednesday night and both will have plenty to catch up on. They were both in the Barça team that started the 1996-97 season by winning the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid 6-4 on aggregate. With Robson in charge and Mourinho’s assisting him the team that won the first silverware of the new season included not just the French World Cup winner and the 62-times Spain international and the aforementioned Lopetegui and Guardiola but Albert Ferrer, who started the season as Cordoba coach; Abelardo Fernandez, who is now coaching Sporting Gijon in Spain’s second tier; and Sergi Barjuan, who has just taken over at Almeria.

Also in the team were Hristo Stoichkov who has coached Celta Vigo and Bulgaria among others and Juan Antonio Pizzi, who managed Valencia last season and is now at Leon in Mexico. Even those players from that team who never went on to manage have stayed in football with Giovanni now working as a scout for Olympiakos and Guillermo Amor a former director of Barcelona’s youth academy who is now director of football at Adelaide United FC. Among the squad players that season were Roberto Prosinecki and Emmanuel Amunike now coach with Azerbaijan and Nigeria’s Under-17s teams respectively.

Enrique travels to Paris to take on Blanc's PSG side at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League . Ahead of his meeting with Blanc on Wednesday, Luis Enrique crossed swords with old friend and former team-mate Sergi Barjuan two weeks ago when Barça played Almeria. “It was the last thing we looked like becoming,” he said when I asked the Barcelona manager if both he and Sergi had looked like coaches-in-waiting in their playing days. “You change the way you look at things once you retire.” Luis Enrique believes those who played in positions where they had the pitch in front of them for most of the game – the full-backs, the centre-backs, Pep Guardiola in holding midfield – went on to coach in part because of how tactically astute they had had to become to be successful in their positions as players. Former Argentinean striker Juan Antonio Pizzi went on to manage Valencia and is now in Mexico . Julen Lopetegui: Porto boss . Albert Ferrer: Former Cordoba coach . Gheorghe Popescu: Jailed for money laundering . Abelardo Fernandez: Sporting Gijon coach . Laurent Blanc: PSG boss . Luis Enrique: Barcelona manager . Sergi Barjuan: Almeria coach .

Michael Laudrup: Former Swansea, Getafe and Mallorca coach . Juan Carlos: Coaching role at Valladolid . Julio Salinas: Television pundit . Hristo Stoichkov: Former Bulgaria and Celta Vigo coach . It’s perhaps more of a surprise that so many attacking players also graduated to the technical area. Some will have got jobs because they played for Barcelona rather than because of all they learned at Barça – it’s the irresistible pull of giving a Barça old boy a job in the hope he will be able to build a side in his former team’s image. But for every failure there has been a success and there is a 50 per cent chance that whoever wins this season’s Champions League, via the coach, Barcelona’s prints will be on the trophy.","Four of Bobby Robson's 1996 squad are still in the Champions League .

391,"A bizarre new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered by a farmer in China and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight. Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat’s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning ‘strange wing’, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world’s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning ""strange wing"" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don’t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how  the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: ‘As for gliding, if Yi qi’s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. ‘But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body — if the bulk of the animal’s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. ‘That is clearly the case in the authors’ reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. ‘Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. ‘And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.’","Yi qi is thought to have lived 160 million years ago during the late Jurassic .
The dinosaur has an unusual bone sticking out of its wrist and had a membrane that covered it to form a wing much like that of a modern bat .

10810,"Wallace, the Chelsea defender on-loan at Vitesse Arnhem, has been released without charge after being questioned by police on ‘suspicion of a sexual offence’. The 20-year-old, who has been loaned out to Fluminense and Inter Milan since he signed for Chelsea in January 2013, was with Vitesse’s squad for their trip to Excelsior and fined by the Dutch club. ‘Wallace won't be in the selection for the match against Excelsior,’ a statement from Vitesse read. Wallace is pictured in action for Chelsea during their pre-season tour of Indonesia back in July 2013 . ‘The Brazilian defender was arrested last night in the centre of Arnhem on suspicion of an offence. ‘Based on the fact that he is to refrain from going out in the 48 hours before a match, Vitesse immediately decided Wallace will be out of the team and will receive a maximum fine. ‘Vitesse has no further announcements.’ While the Dutch club refused to comment on the nature of the offence which led to the arrest, a police spokesman is quoted by local media as saying it was 'sexual’. The 20-year-old right back is pictured playing for Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem in February of this year . ‘We still don't know what exactly happened,’ police spokesman Paul Koetsier told RTL. ‘That must be found out during the investigation. ‘We can't make it more concrete than a suspicion of a sexual offence. Maybe there will me more information later today.’ Wallace is on a season-long loan at Vitesse. The Dutch outfit enjoy a close relationship with the Blues and the club’s owner Alexander Chigrinsky is an associate of Roman Abramovich. Wallace, a Brazilian Under-20 international, made his debut for Jose Mourinho’s side during their summer tour of Asia in 2013 before his season on loan at Inter.

8966,"(CNN)Italians have a saying: ""Too much of something cripples it."" We're overcrowded with so many frescoed churches, medieval castles and Roman ruins that we simply don't know what to do with them, let alone care for a proper upkeep. We've turned blind to their value and beauty. There are nearly 5,000 ""gems"" scattered across the country, ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments. Italy boasts the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage sites in the world -- 50, several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources. And there are another 42,000 that are at the mercy of mudslides, floods and natural calamities. The UNESCO-listed Basilica of Assisi, where St. Frances' tomb lies, is just the last of a series of national shames. Its frescoed walls by Renaissance masters including Giotto risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle. In a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise 500,000 euros. We're talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world -- not to mention its artistic value. I remember once an American colleague asking me: ""But what does Italy do with its immense cultural heritage""? Good question. If other nations had half as much of what we boast, they'd make a much better job with it. Paradoxically, if we had just the Coliseum or Venice it would be easier. But we don't and trouble is Italy doesn't know how to exploit this treasure. Take the British Museum's successful exhibition on Pompeii in 2013: we have the real site in our backyard but the British made the best of it worldwide while the real Pompeii was -- and still is -- making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses. Or, worse, Italy couldn't care less to promote its assets. As a travel writer I have the misfortune of dealing with tourist offices almost on a daily basis and it's a battle: many are reluctant to give information and have no good photos of places. I find myself almost begging them, when it should be the other way round. The true but sad thing is that restyling in Italy is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors. Crowdfunding has already saved Bologna's San Luca Portico. The Coliseum is getting a makeover thanks to shoe brand Todd's, while a few visionary businessmen are rescuing crumbling villages by turning them into luxury resorts. Yet it's not just a matter of scarce public resources or austerity-driven measures. It's also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment, the care to cherish a country's valuable monuments. And that's because Italians have always lacked a sense of national belonging: Italy, despite its millenary history, is one of the world's most modern states, unified in 1861. Patriot Massimo D'Azeglio once said: ""Now that we've made Italy, we need to make Italians."" Tough job indeed, and we're still a long way to go. There's also wide-spread approach that tends to limit restyling in general. Heritage authorities are in love with the Romantic ideal ""of decadent ruins"": better leave the monument or site as it is, even allow it to rot, rather than recover it and ""destroy its original beauty."" Each time new subway works bring to light an unknown Roman theatre or necropoli, it all freezes - the public works and the artistic upkeep. Preservation is equal to negligence and oblivion. But that's a blind approach. There's so much Italy could do with what it has, that it could live off tourism.  Symbola Foundation estimates that culture and art, if well exploited, could generate a turnover of 214 billion euros a year, amounting to 15.3% of GDP. Another thorny issue is having a cheap culture. Entrance tickets to the Coliseum, Italy's top site that each year lures more than 6 million tourists, cost a maximum of 12 euros. Matera's rock crypts are 5 euros. Not to mention churches featuring Michelangelo's works, which are free to enter. The first time I visited Westminster Abbey in London, and St. Patrick's church in Dublin, I was shocked to find out I had to pay to get in. And it was quite expensive, too. One could argue that Italy does well to open for free the Lord's doors, but probably in some ""critical"" cases a minimum cost to enter wouldn't hurt. The country's mindset needs to change, too. Monuments and works of art are not dead, but living things that deserve to be sexed-up once in a while. If we don't have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance, why not give them over to other countries to run? Or sell them to rich businessmen? Similar options make state authorities' hair stand on end: they stress art belongs to the Italian people and should remain in public hands -- even if it's inaccessible and unenjoyable. Yet is it better to have a public ruin or a private, thriving multimedia museum? The Uffizi Galleries' secret cellars are stacked with 2,500 forgotten masterpieces, which could be leased out to privates. Curators fear the artworks could get damaged if moved. But cobwebs and dust can do no harm, right? Our sunny piazzas, bridges and frescoed castles should be regularly rented out for lavish ceremonies and weddings of billionaires couples or for major company events that would bring millions of euros to cities' coffers. And who cares if for one single evening residents are unable to park their car in front of their palazzo? There are also 6,000 abandoned medieval ""ghost towns"" that could be recovered or sold to revamp local economy. The state should also speed up the process of putting up for auction hundreds of artistic sites and historical buildings to privates and international investors who get to run them for 50 years. Since the project launch in 2012 so far just two restyles have worked out, one being a Renaissance villa in Florence turned into a deluxe spa resort. Fine, Rome wasn't built in a day. But it could crumble in an hour.","Italy boasts the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage sites in the world .

4258,"A year since the death of former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova, his memory lives on at the club where he played an integral part in the most successful era in its history. Vilanova died aged 45 on April 25 last year after a long battle against parotid gland cancer that cut short the life of a coach in his prime. The way he steadfastly attempted to carry on despite his illness in his typically understated manner drew much admiration and there was a considerable outpouring of sadness at his passing. It is one year since Tito Vilanova, the beloved Barcelona coach, died aged 45 after a long battle with cancer . Vilanova's memory lives on at the club where he played an integral part in its most successful era . People from the sporting world and many others attended a memorial service at Barcelona cathedral to pay tribute. Vilanova was Pep Guardiola's assistant during a golden spell for the club when they won three La Liga titles and two Champions League trophies from 2008-12. While Guardiola was the public face, Vilanova worked hard behind the scenes as Barca not only won trophies but did it by taking apart opposition teams with their brand of short-passing football that became known as 'tiki-taka'. Vilanova would take charge of preparing the strategy and advise on potential signings as Barca went on to win 14 out of a possible 19 trophies. While Pep Guardiola's assistant, Vilanova was part of a golden spell for the club including three La Liga titles . Barcelona players were among hundred who gathered at Barcelona Cathedral to pay tribute to Vilanova . A banner reads 'Tito forever eternal' while a Barca fan with a shirt saying 'Thanks Tito, always eternal' leaves a gift during a memorial at the Nou Camp . The pair knew each other from passing through Barca's youth system but Vilanova was let go in 1990 and played for several lower league teams before finally getting his chance in the Spanish top flight with Celta Vigo in the mid-1990s. It was as a coach that he really made his mark though and after Guardiola left, he took charge of the Barca first team. Barcelona went on to make a record start to a La Liga season with 18 wins from 19 games but in December 2012, Vilanova was diagnosed with cancer for a second time. It meant his assistant Jordi Roura took charge of the team on those occasions when he was undergoing treatment. Barca won the league but at the end of the season, Vilanova announced he was resigning to concentrate on his recovery from the illness. He is fondly remembered at the club for not only being a Barcelona man but also his unassuming manner and in February this year a pitch at their training ground was named after him.","Tito Vilanova died aged 45 on April 25 last year after a long cancer battle .

8434,"Liverpool just edged past Blackburn Rovers in their FA Cup sixth round replay to make it to a 24th Cup semi-final in the Anfield club's illustrious history.

10301,"British Olympic chief Bill Sweeney insists the association worked 'really hard' to keep Aaron Cook on board - but the 24-year-old was set on changing his nationality and competing for Moldova at the 2016 Olympics. Dorset-born Cook who was overlooked for the Great Britain taekwondo squad at London 2012, applied for citizenship earlier this month after receiving funding from Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici and has already received his passport from the small eastern European state. The British Olympic Association (BOA) announced on Thursday morning that they had ratified the 24-year-old's move - issuing a statement to confirm the news. Taekwondo fighter Aaron Cook's application to switch allegiances to Moldova has been approved . Three time European champion Aaron Cook (right) has refused to fight for Great Britain since May 2012 . Cook has felt aggrieved at the decision to leave him out of the 2012 London Olympic squad . 'Following a request from taekwondo athlete Aaron Cook to change his sporting nationality from British to Moldovan, the British Olympic Association (BOA) today announced that Cook's request has been approved,' it read. 'The board of the British Olympic Association met on Monday 13 April 2015 to discuss Aaron Cook's request to change his sporting nationality.' There had been long-standing animosity from Cook towards GB Taekwondo after he felt he had been kept out of the squad for London 2012 because he had decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Lutalo Muhammed was selected instead and won the bronze medal, but Sweeney says the door was open for Cook - who has instead opted to represent Moldova. 'We are very disappointed,' the BOA chief executive told BBC Radio Five. 'He is world number one and Olympic-ranked number two. He is a great athlete... and we are saddened to lose an athlete of that calibre who is British. 'For him to move from his country of birth and home nation to represent another country - we are disappointed. 'I can promise you we have been working really hard not only in recent months but for a long time now, both with Aaron and his representatives and British Taekwondo. It has been well documented that there have been some difficulties in that relationship that go back to pre-2012. 'We have been looking to find a solution where we could broker that deal. We have worked hard to make sure there is a robust and fair selection policy in place. He was the name quota athlete to go to Baku European Games in June but in his mind he feels his best opportunity to get to the Olympic Games in 2016 is with another country.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, announced his intention to change nationality in a statement on Facebook at the start of April, saying: 'Although I am upset and disappointed I will not represent my country of birth at another major championships, I felt I had no other option. 'Having received no funding or support from the GB system and financing myself since June 2011, this was not a situation that was acceptable to me and I did not want to put myself, family, friends, supporters or sport through the same situation we were forced to endure at the London 2012 Olympic Games.' Jeremy Beard, the chairman of GB Taekwondo, said in a statement: 'Having secured his place at the upcoming European Games, we are naturally disappointed that Aaron Cook does not wish to represent Great Britain in Baku, nor at the Olympic Games in Rio. 'We have made exhaustive efforts to engage with him and his team for some time, but sadly it seems that he has made the decision that his future lies elsewhere and we wish him well. British Olympic chief Bill Sweeney says there was nothing that could have stopped Cook switching . Cook competes against Mauro Sarmiento at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 . Jamie Cunningham, Cook's former agent, is pleased he has a pathway to the Olympic games . 'Our focus now is on providing the best support we can to the athletes striving to achieve medal success for Great Britain in Baku, at the upcoming World Championships in Russia next month and ultimately at the Olympic Games in 2016.' Cook has previously said he hopes to represent Moldova for the first time at the inaugural Baku European Games in June. His former agent, Jamie Cunningham, tweeted: 'Delighted @aaroncooktkd has clear route to #Rio @& opp to show 2012 was personal.

8813,"Diego Simeone is made for England. Though his collapse under the weight of a mere brush with David Beckham’s boot in 1998 saw him characterised as the antithesis of Anglo-Saxon values, he is, in reality, more English than the English. For that night in St Etienne - almost the last time an England team truly thrilled a global audience at the World Cup, even if they did so in defeat – is remembered by Simeone for more than his notorious role in Beckham’s sending off, which left England down to ten men for most of the match. 'That game was the best international match I've played in,' said Simeone, remembering the World Cup knock out match, which Argentina won on penalties after a 2-2 draw. Given that he played 106 times for his country that is some compliment. Diego Simeone is hoping to lead Atletico Madrid to second successive Champions League final . England's David Beckham kicks out at former midfielder midfielder Simeone during the 1998 World Cup . 'I love playing against the English,’ Simeone added. ‘They're so passionate, so aggressive, so committed. They were incredible that night. Alan Shearer and Paul Ince were extraordinary. At times it seemed Shearer was fighting us on his own. You have to remember they played for 70 minutes with 10 men.’ And as Simeone stalked out on to the pitch at the end of the Champions League final last year, in full confrontational mode, seeking out Raphael Varane, who had kicked the ball at the Atletico bench in celebration of Real Madrid’s 4-1 win, it was hard to not to get the image of the warrior footballer out of your head. There is much more to Simeone than that of course. He had come within two minutes of winning that Champions League final on a wage bill which was famously less than QPR’s. Since that defeat, he has exacted his revenge at every turn. Real Madrid were beaten in the Spanish Super Cup over two legs, then knocked out of the Copa del Rey, also over two legs, by Atletico, beaten at the Bernebeu and then, most spectacularly , beaten 4-0 at the Vicente Calderon last February. Beckham looks towards the referee during the World Cup clash between England and Argentina . The former England man was shown a red card for lashing out at Simeone during the knock-out match . Last week the teams drew 0-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final; on Wednesday they resume hostilities at the Bernebeu. Real may be marginal favourites but under Simeone, Atletico have gone from the side that could never beat Real Madrid – they hadn’t won for 14 years against them – to the side that (almost) never loses to them. What is always unclear to outside observers is how the man famed for his confrontations and aggression became one of the most tactically astute coaches in Europe. Of course, he always had leadership qualities and undeniable charisma. In his native Argentina they always assumed he would be a manager, such was his dominance of the national team as a captain. But his early results were very mixed. He looked innovative and the man to watch at Estudiantes, where he was one of the first to use motivational video clips from films to inspire his players. It worked: they chased down Boca Juniors for the league title even if he was, in those days, criticised for being overly focused on attacking players. At River Plate though, it looked as if fighting talk and charisma only got you so far. He finished bottom of the league and had to resign. The Atleti boss confronts Raphael Varane during Real Madrid's 4-1 Champions League final win last year . Simeone speaks to referee Bjorn Kuipers during the showpiece final at the Estadio da Luz . He revived his reputation somewhat at Catania and Racing but when he was given the Atletico job in 2011, it seemed more like the old boys’ network at work – he was an iconic player there in the 1990s – than the result of a meticulous recruitment process scouring the best tactical minds in Europe . Of course, the success has been unrelenting, with a trophy every year: the Europa League in 2012; the Copa Del Rey in 2013, beating Jose Mourinho’s Real in the final; and the extraordinary feat of wining La Liga ahead of Barca and Real last season. This year he is comfortably-placed for another Champions League spot but the title is out of the question. Carlo Ancelotti though is right to be nervous ahead of Wednesday’s quarter final. If there were a team for the big occasion, it is Simeone’s Atletico. The 44-year-old got the better of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho during his side's 3-1 victory at Stamford Bridge . He makes a habit of out-witting Europe’s best minds. It isn’t just Ancelotti who has been his victim. Mourinho, too, back in that 2013 cup final and then again last season, when Atletico stunned Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Having brought the game back to 1-1 and being ahead on away goals, you might have expected Simeon’s side to sit back. But they came out for the second half pressing even harder, pushing forwards whenever they could. In effect, Simone did precisely what the opposition least expected and were rewarded with a 3-1 win. And yet there is something very English about Simeone’s style. It’s not just the frequent use of 4-4-2, the wide men, the directness of their play at time and the physicality - it’s their fighting spirit which characterises them and which might be stamped: ‘Made in England.’ It’s why Simeone so related to Shearer and Ince and their performance in that extraordinary 2-2 draw in St Etienne. Ince, Shearer, Simeone; they’re all cast from the same mould. The Argentine manager is understandably adored by the Atletico faithful despite his team's combative style . The Atletico players circle around Simeone as they prepare for the Champions League clash against Madrid . He’s not about to move, having just signed a new contract with Atletico until 2020 and we may never see him in the Premier League. The problem for Simone is that his English values are no longer fashionable in England. When Manchester City choose a new manager, it will be someone who can help to bring tiki taka football to the club, from academy to the first team, under the direction of Txiki Begiristain. When Arsenal appoint, pretty football rather than fighting spirit are likely to be high up the agenda of the new coach. Manchester United, now establishment, might baulk at a street fighter as manager, though they had one once before and he didn’t do so badly. He would be adored at Liverpool, but it would be another gear change from the Brendan Rodgers style that the club has embraced. Chelsea, too, though falling back on Mourinho, also have had the Barcelona model in mind and are thought to be unimpressed with Simeone. Maybe he has simply made too many enemies over the years. But Simeone is useful antidote to those who think English football’s traditional strengths have no place in the modern game. Perhaps he’s just become too English for the new England .

Simeone is tossed  in the air by his players as they celebrate their Spanish league title last season .","Diego Simeone has worked wonders with La Liga side Atletico Madrid .

1862,"After years of negotiations, Stephen King's hit novel series The Dark Tower is on its way to big and small screens near you. The revered writer, who penned Shawshank Redemption and The Shining, slammed Warner Brothers in 2012 for dropping plans to make a movie trilogy and TV mini-series. Finally, three years later, things are back on track - this time with Sony. Finally: Stephen King has announced Sony will be putting his 'magnum opus' The Dark Tower in cinemas . These are just two of the eight novels which King spent over 40 years writing. The movie and TV version is said to mainly stem from the first novel, The Gunslinger (left), focusing on the lead character Roland . 'I'm excited that The Dark Tower is finally going to appear on the screen,' King said in a statement. 'Those who have traveled with Roland and his friends in their search for the Dark Tower are going to have their long-held hopes fully realized. This is a brilliant and creative approach to my books.' The eight-book series written between 1970 and 2012 follows a 'gunslinger' on his journey towards a tower. Describing his self-professed 'magnum opus', King said it combines the essences of the Wild West, science fiction, and Lord Of The Rings. Like J. R. R. Tolkien's celebrated trilogy, The Dark Tower has its own unique language. According to Deadline, the newfangled project has an entirely new script which focuses on the relationship between Roland and Jake in Gunslinger, the first book. A provisional script has been written by Akiva Goldsman (Cinderella Man) and Jeff Pinkner (Lost). Rumored leads: Javier Bardem (left) and Russell Crowe (right) are said to be interested in the lead role . Three years on, Javier Bardem and Russell Crowe are still rumored to be interested in the lead role. Sony chairman Tom Rothman said in a statement: 'There are few projects out there that compare with the scope, vision, complex characters and fully drawn world that Stephen King has created with The Dark Tower. 'I am a giant fan. And, as Stephen himself does, we love the direction that Akiva and Jeff have taken. This is a great opportunity for a director to put his or her stamp on a cool global franchise.' When Warner Bros dropped the deal - initiated by Universal - King told a press conference: 'The Dark Tower, to me, and I’m not unbiased because I’m the writer on this thing, but to me it looks like gold on the ground waiting to be picked up.'","Warner Bros slammed by novelist for dropping the deal in 2012 .

10070,"(CNN)Monty Python in a movie? What a silly idea. But the timing was right for the gang of British comedians (along with their token American, Terry Gilliam), who were looking to hit the big screen after four seasons of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" their groundbreaking British TV series. ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" which premiered 40 years ago Thursday, was the result. The movie, a spoof of the Arthurian legend, did not start auspiciously. The budget was small -- about $400,000, half of it supplied by rock stars, including Genesis and Pink Floyd. On the first day of filming in Scotland -- the first shot, in fact -- the camera broke. The weather was bad. The hotel was dismal. Python member Graham Chapman was suffering from alcohol withdrawal. It got better. On the day of its first American screening in New York, a thousand people were in line by 8 a.m. Thanks to the popularity of ""Python"" on American TV, the movie was a box-office hit, making $5 million -- more than 10 times its budget. More importantly, it soon became a comedy classic. The dialogue alone has been widely quoted, with such lines as ""It's just a flesh wound"" and ""Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries"" referenced on shows such as ""The Simpsons,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Blacklist.""  Python member Eric Idle turned the film into the Tony-winning Broadway play ""Spamalot."" The troupe ended up making three movies -- well, four, if you count ""And Now for Something Completely Different,"" five if you include ""Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,"" five-and-a-half if you allow ""The Rutles,"" six if you ... well, three. We'll say three. Is there a best one? Where should you start? Let's break them down: . From its dramatic opening credits featuring fake-Swedish subtitles to the adventures of Sir Launcelot (""the boldest and most expensive of the knights""), weighted-bird computations and sudden animator heart attacks, ""Holy Grail"" is probably the loosest and most Python-esque of the Python oeuvre. As a movie with a plot and character and all that movie nonsense, it falls short -- but as a repository for some of Python's best gags, it remains perhaps the best (and certainly most quotable) of the bunch. Besides, it features the word ""shrubbery."" "" 'Grail' is a bit like 'A Hard Day's Night,' "" Idle observed in the Pythons' autobiography. ""It's got a joie de vivre that's very infectious, it's very hard not to like."" Pros: The dialogue. The Black Knight. The Knights Who Say ""Ni."" Cons: It's sometimes sloppy. And it doesn't really have an ending. Verdict: Better than a cheese shop full of ex-parrots. Probably Python's most consistent movie, ""Life of Brian"" is the story of a guy born down the road from Jesus who finds himself hailed as a messiah and ends up crucified. It was a satire on organized religion, first-century politics and zealotry -- one of the best bits is the ongoing argument between ""the People's Front of Judea"" and ""the Judean People's Front"" -- but try telling that to the protesters. The film was picketed in cities across the United States, deplored by some religious leaders and banned in Ireland and Norway. (Sweden promoted it with the line, ""The film so funny that it was banned in Norway."") It did have one huge supporter: ex-Beatle George Harrison, who mortgaged his estate to help fund the movie when a financier pulled out. ""He paid for it because he wanted to see it,"" Idle recalled. ""The most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history."" Pros: Graham Chapman's performance as Brian. ""What have the Romans ever done for us?"" ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" Cons: The adventurous but ultimately pointless animated-alien scene. Michael Palin's lisping Pilate (though, to be fair, it's so childishly broad you can't help but laugh). Verdict: Funnier than the Spanish Inquisition. ""Meaning of Life,"" constructed as a series of sketches, is the most uneven of the three narrative Python films. After the stunning opening sequence, Gilliam's ""The Crimson Permanent Assurance"" -- about the revenge of some pirate-like accountants -- the film struggles to find its footing. Even the Pythons thought so. ""The rhythms weren't right,"" said Gilliam. ""It needed a whole other rewrite,"" said Idle. Nevertheless, it has its moments: the ""Every Sperm Is Sacred"" sequence, about religion, sex and contraception; the organ donor who's surprised by a demand for his liver; and -- of course -- the infamous Mr. Creosote, the absurdly fat man who gorges on a monstrous meal at a posh restaurant, regurgitates it at length, and is then encouraged to have a ""wafer-thin"" after-dinner mint -- with disastrous results. It also has the sweetest of all Python songs: Idle's ""The Galaxy Song,"" which is even more uplifting than ""Brian's"" ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" Not a bad conclusion, given what happened to Mr. Creosote. Pros: ""Permanent Assurance."" Mr. Creosote. ""The Galaxy Song."" Cons: The fish. The schoolmaster's sex lesson. The fish. Verdict: More enjoyable than watching the Upper-Class Twit of the Year competition.","""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" celebrates 40 years Thursday .

10723,"(CNN)A New Jersey auction house has removed items from its April 17 event after an uproar from the public. The items are crafts and artifacts made by Japanese-Americans confined to World War II internment camps. A grass-roots campaign of a change.org petition, a Facebook page, and mediation by ""Star Trek"" actor George Takei has resulted in Rago Arts and Auction Center agreeing to pull the items from the sale. ""There is an essential discussion to be had about the sale of historical items that are a legacy of man's inhumanity to man. It extends beyond what is legal. It is something auction houses, galleries and dealers are faced with regularly,"" the auction house said. ""We hope this controversy will be the beginning of a discourse on this issue."" Takei, who with his family spent time in one of the camps, thanked people for working to stop the sale. According to a comment on the Facebook page ""Japanese American History: NOT for Sale,"" he was working on the issue while on a trip to Australia. ""It took a few calls today here in the wee hours, and I'll be issuing a formal statement later, but we can all celebrate a bit today at this news,"" he wrote. The auction house said 24 lots of an original collection of works of art and crafts were removed. During World War II, about 117,000 people of Japanese descent were forced to live in 10 internment camps. The government called them relocation centers. Many of the people who lived there and their descendants had another phrase for the facilities. They call them concentration camps. Two-thirds of the people who were ordered there were native born U.S. citizens, according to the National Archives. CNN affiliate KGO reported the items were given to historian Allen Eaton, who opposed internment camps. The items were inherited from the historian's estate. Miriam Tucker, a partner with the auction house, said it had hoped the items would go to someone who cared about their historical meaning. ""For us, there could be no better resolution than for a suitable museum, foundation or members of the Japanese-American community with the means to preserve this collection to come forward and secure it for education, display and research,"" she said. KGO reported the people it talked to would like items returned to family members if possible and any other artifacts put in an exhibition. ""This was a gift and let the gift come full circle,"" said Judy Hamaguchi with the San Francisco Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League. She was referring to a letter the organization sent to the auction house. ""It should be returned as a gift."" The lots have been packed away for now, said auction house partner David Rago in an email. ""Once the dust settles from this auction weekend (1,200 lots in three days) we will work with a small group of people from the Japanese-American community who have identified themselves through this process as generous, informed, voices of reason,"" he wrote. He said a suitable institution is the best possible home and the auction house will work with the current owner to find the right place. The seller -- known in the auction business as the consignor -- has never been in a position where the items could be donated, Rago said. ""But the consignor, who has been a sensitive and dedicated custodian of this collection for over 35 years, has agreed this evening to work with Rago Auctions to secure appropriate placement of Eaton's life work,"" he added.","The items were originally given to a historian who opposed the camps, CNN affiliate reports .

The fact the football club aren’t doing so sends a very poor message. 'Most of the clubs put money ahead of morality and I think it is disgraceful because it just sends a message out to people that, actually, all they’re interested in is their results, all they’re interested in is winning.’ However, Jim Gilling, secretary of the Coxhoe Supporters’ Group, believes Johnson should be free to play. ‘It’s the right decision,’ he said. ‘We have to remember he is not guilty of anything yet. ‘But the club have left their decision open and it may well be that they reverse it should circumstances change.’ Manager Dick Advocaat supports the club’s stance and admits Johnson is ‘an important player’ as they fight relegation. But many fans are concerned that the decision has been taken on footballing grounds given the threat to their top-flight status. Steve Dean, secretary of the SAFC Liaison Group, told Sportsmail: ‘I am very surprised the club did not suspend him. ‘Going out of the Premier League would cost the club millions of pounds and that is often the first consideration these days.

If they were in mid-table I suspect it might have been different. Clive Dent, secretary of the Sedgefield Supporters’ Group, agrees. ‘I would prefer it if he didn’t play,’ he said. ‘Now he has been charged he is going to be even more of a target for supporters. He’s going to get hammered.’ Advocaat was not consulted over the issue. He will decide whether Johnson is in the right frame of mind to start on Saturday. And the Dutch boss said: ‘I’ve got a decision to make (as to whether I play him). He is an important player for us. The club have made a statement and I stand behind that.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Adam Johnson could feature against Stoke on Saturday afternoon .

The former Illinois governor has return to his roots while inside and has been photographed with his still full head of hair a shocking white color rather than the boot polish black that was his trademark as a politician. Blagojevich was infamously caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president in 2008. Fade to gray: Once famed for his mop of blacker than black hair, disgraced Democrat Rod Blagojevich, 58, has really let his haircare regime go while he serves his prison time . Back in his days as governor of Illinois, Blagojevich was famed for his boot polish black hair . He was impeached and removed from office by the state Legislature in early 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver. The photos, the first of Blagojevich in prison, were first published by the National Enquirer. The photos show the former governor sitting at a desk, reading a book and wearing glasses and sitting outside in shorts and a wife beater shirt. While he continues to awaiting word on a last-ditch appeal, Blagojevich has daily contact with his family and teaches the history of war battles to other inmates, his attorney said. Last July lawyers attempted to argue that a high court ruling in McCutcheon v. the Federal Election Commission in April 2014 bolstered their view that Blagojevich was engaged in legal, run-of-the-mill political horse trading, not corruption. The McCutcheon ruling, they argued, found that soliciting contributions crosses the line into corruption only when a politician makes a clear, explicit promise to take official action in return for a donation. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver after he was caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president . In that context, defense attorneys said the trial judge was wrong to set a lower standard for jurors by telling them, to convict, they only needed to find that Blagojevich sought donations 'knowing or believing' it would be given for some official act. But government attorneys responded saying that Blagojevich's legal team hadn't correctly characterized the Supreme Court's findings in McCutcheon. 'The decision provides no support for Blagojevich's argument on appeal,' the two-page filing said. 'Nothing in the (McCutcheon) decision suggests that an exchange of contributions for specific official acts is quid pro quo corruption only if the arrangement is stated 'explicitly' or 'expressly.'' The Chicago-based appellate court has been considering Blagojevich's appeal for more than a year months. It's unclear when it might issue a decision.","The former Illinois governor has been photographed in prison for the first time since starting his 14 year sentence in 2012 .

916,"Controversial Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary claims the budget airline will slash its fares by as much as 15 per cent over the next two years. The chief executive of Europe’s largest budget airline made the vow in an interview with a French weekly newspaper, saying its average fare could be as low as €40 (approximately £26) next year. It would be a €6 (£4) decrease from Ryanair’s current average ticket price, with Mr O’Leary attributing the anticipated fare cuts to lower oil prices. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary took aim at Air France in his interview with Le Journal du Dimanche . Famed for his combative management style, Mr O’Leary told Le Journal du Dimanche the Dublin-based discount carrier will pass the oil savings on to customers and claimed most European airlines have an average ticket price of €170 for a short flight. He said Ryanair expects to grow its passenger numbers and cut costs with new Boeing aircraft that will have more seats and reduce fuel consumption by an average of 18 per cent – without compromising passenger safety or security. In his interview with the Sunday newspaper the airline boss, who has made strides to soften his image, took shots at Air France, touting Ryanair as a cheaper and more reliable airline. He ridiculed Air France for last year’s pilots’ strike, which reportedly cost the Paris-based carrier hundreds of millions of pounds, predicted more troubled times and accused the airline of impeding growth at regional airports. An Air France spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that the airline is not responding to Mr O'Leary's comments. Michael O'Leary said he despises the 'French political class', but loves France and the French . Mr O’Leary was put on the defensive several times in the wide-ranging interview, as he disputed claims that Ryanair staff face poor working conditions and wages. The chief executive claimed there is a waiting list of 300 pilots and nearly 1,000 flight attendants who want to work for Ryanair. He told the newspaper: ‘All the things we hear about Ryanair are nonsense. Many companies such as Air France cut jobs. We create, we increase salaries and we pay pension contributions.’ Mr O’Leary also had to explain his feelings towards the French, telling Le Journal du Dimanche that he ‘despises the French political class’ that ‘destroyed the economy’, but loves France and the French. The airline boss disputed claims that Ryanair staff face poor working conditions and wages . He defended Ryanair’s decision not to employ workers in France year-round, saying it is due to the ‘administrative madness’ of labour laws and taxation. Ryanair has long faced complaints of poor customer service and excessive surcharges, but recently launched a marketing push to win over customers and has eased some of its fees or restrictions. It operates 31 airports in France, and Mr O’Leary said its Paris hub will continue to be Beauvais-Tilly, about 55 miles north of the French capital. He said acquiring slots at Charles de Gaulle or Paris Orly airports – which are hubs for Air France-KLM and their subsidiaries – presents an expensive challenge.","Chief executive Michael O'Leary made the vow to a French newspaper .

315,"This is the dramatic moment a brave village watchman fought off a wild leopard armed with only a stick in India. The incident took place in Olani village, four kilometres from Manpur, in central India and was recorded by terrified villagers from the relative safety of hut rooftops. To try and protect his fellow villagers, the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon. The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him . Watched on by a crowd of bystanders, the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws . Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth, he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick . After a few terrifying seconds, the leopard - inches away from the man's bare feet - eventually runs off . He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated, dumping the ward to the ground. Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man. Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move, the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off. Mahendra Sharma, a school teacher, said: 'Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast.' According to local media, the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter. In last year's Indian elections, rural communities blamed the government for placing them at risk of leopard attacks by failing to provide basic infrastructure such as electrical lighting and street lighting.

10590,"Two states at the center of gay rights protests over laws designed to 'uphold religious freedom' engaged in hurried climbdowns yesterday, with both approving alterations to legislation that critics said legalized discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'Now that this is behind us, let's move forward together with a renewed commitment to the civility and respect that make this state great,' Indiana Governor Mike Pence said after signing his state's amended measure. The Arkansas legislature also passed changes to its legislation at the behest of the state's Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson, who rejected a previous version of the bill at the last minute on Wednesday following public uproar and a personal plea from his son. Hutchinson signed the new legislation last night. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signs a reworked religious freedom bill into law on Thursday evening. Lawmakers in Arkansas and Indiana hoped that by amending their states' measures they would quiet the national uproar over new religious objections that opponents say are designed to offer a legal defense for anti-gay discrimination . 'Now that this is behind us, let's move forward together with a renewed commitment to the civility and respect that make this state great,' Indiana Governor Mike Pence said after signing his state's amended measure Thursday evening . Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma speaks at a press conference announcing changes to the state's religious freedom law as Senate President Pro Tem David Long, left, looks on. The GOP leaders on Thursday added anti-discrimination safeguards to the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . 'I think it’s sending the right signal, the way this has been resolved, to the world and the country that Arkansas understands the diversity of our culture and workforce but also the importance of balancing that with our sincerely held religious convictions,' Hutchinson said. The recently empowered governor also suggested he'd issue an executive order banning discrimination in the workplace for state employees, according to a CNN report. The two, GOP-controlled states were in a frenzy this week to quell national outrage over legislation meant to satisfy evangelicals who do not believe they should be compelled by the government to provide goods and services to certain customers if doing so would violate their religious convictions. The moves had the direct effect of upsetting gay and lesbian individuals, however, and incited massive protests. After gay rights activists, sympathetic businesses and celebrities thrust the measures into the national spotlight, both states found themselves in the cross-hairs, and even Republican lawmakers began to distance themselves from the laws as written. Republican leaders in the Hoosier State conceded this week to critics arguing that their state's law, signed into effect by Governor Mike Pence a week ago today, inadvertently left room for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'It was never intended to discriminate against anyone,' Indiana Senate President Pro Tem David Long said at a Thursday morning at a press conference. Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, standing alongside Long, said, 'Hoosier hospitality had to be restored.' 'It is causing real harm to real people right now in our state. I'm not talking about those who feel their rights are being infringed, I'm talking about commerce in a major, major way,' Bosma said of the law Thursday . Acknowledging that the changes to the law won't necessarily satisfy religious groups, he said, 'we had to be prompt. We had to be swift.' Opponents of an Arkansas religious objection measure chant 'We Are Arkansas' as they face the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson earlier that day said he wants the legislature to either recall the bill from his desk or pass a follow-up measure that would make the proposal more closely mirror a 1993 federal religious-freedom law . In addition to the already protected classes of persons, the new language specifies that businesses, individuals and other providers cannot refuse to do business with persons on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. No one has the legal right to 'refuse to offer or provide' goods, services, facilities or employment to anyone for those reasons, it says. Exempted from the new rules, however, are churches and non-profit religious organizations, including schools. After adamantly defending the state's law in the national press, Pence suddenly said Tuesday that 'it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone.' The 180 earned him the mocking of the White House, which described him as a 'previously defiant governor' who changed his position after a 'bipartisan and even nonpolitical outcry.' Pence said Thursday he believed the move to change the legislation was in the best way forward for his state. 'There will be some who think this legislation goes too far and some who think it does not go far enough, but as governor I must always put the interest of our state first and ask myself every day, 'What is best for Indiana?' Pence said in a statement. 'I believe resolving this controversy and making clear that every person feels welcome and respected in our state is best for Indiana.' Demonstrators hold signs on the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol thanking Hutchinson for calling for changes to the religious freedom measure. A new version of Arkansas' law is now making its way through the statehouse. The altered bill would more closely mirror federal legislation . The new version of Arkansas' law  more closely mirrors federal legislation. The fixes passed the state's Senate Wednesday night and its House Thursday. Hutchinson on Wednesday had requested the legislative changes, saying he could not sign the bill until they were made. 'How do we as a state communicate to the world that we are respectful of a diverse workplace and we want to be known as a state that does not discriminate but understands tolerance?' he said during a press conference outside the state Capitol. 'That is the challenge we face. Making this law like the federal law will aid us in that effort in communication, but also was my original objective from the beginning.' Upon signing the bill Thursday, Hutchinson said, 'I know it's been a contentious debate.' 'We resolved it in an Arkansas way and in the right way for our country and for the people of Arkansas.' Hutchinson said he recognizes this is not the end of the debate, 'but the fact that it might not solve every problem for everyone probably means it's a good bill.' Conservative lawmakers said they didn't appreciate the slap in the face from Hutchinson, who had said numerous times in the past that he would approve the legislation in its current form when it reached his desk, but they worked to make the necessary adjustments just the same. 'I don't feel it was right for the governor to say he was going to sign something that he watched all the way through and didn't sign,' state senator Terry Rice told Arkansas Online. 'I know things come up at the last minute but now we have hodgepodged some bills together.' That sentiment was shared by Arkansas Family Council, a group that favors the law and pushed to get it passed. 'I'm very puzzled at this point to see why the bill would need to be amended at this late date, considering everybody in the chamber has had a chance to see it,' Jerry Cox, the group's leader, said. 'I think it's been thoroughly vetted, and it's a good law.' A family-owned pizzeria in Indiana that said it wouldn't cater same-sex weddings shut down until further notice on Wednesday after the owners received threatening phone calls, and the establishment's YELP page was flooded with bad reviews . Indiana, the first of the two states to pass the offending religious liberty legislation, saw a fierce backlash over the weekend and early this week that included thousands of protesters descending on the state Capitol and a prominent local business cancelling a planned $40 million expansion of its headquarters after Pence formally approved the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Hutchinson, who took office just two months ago, seeking to avoid an uprising of equal intensity in his own state, pushed legislators in Arkansas to make adjustments to their bill before he put his name on it. The Arkansas-based retail corporation Wal-Mart publicly lobbied the Republican politician not to approve the bill, labeling it as discriminatory. Meanwhile, in Indiana, a family-owned pizzeria, Memories, that said it wouldn't cater same-sex weddings shut down until further notice on Wednesday after the owners received threatening phone calls and the establishment's YELP page was flooded with bad reviews.","New Indiana law: No one has the legal right to 'refuse to offer or provide' goods, services, facilities or employment to anyone in previously protected classes or based on sexual orientation or gender identity .

1436,"As Prime Minister David Cameron puts it, on St George’s Day  we should ‘celebrate everything it is to be English’. But what does it mean to be English? From the Romans, Saxons and Normans many hundreds of years ago to those from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Philippines today, England has always been shaped by migration. To mark St George’s Day today, with a little help from WorldRemit, FEMAIL reveals the seemingly very English things that have actually been brought to England by people from abroad - and you may be surprised by the origins of your favourite things. Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a  British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO . Is anything more English than rubbing shoulders with the high-rollers at a polo match at the height of summer? The actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in  Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia. The first-ever recorded polo tournament was way back in 600BC when the Turkomans beat the Persians in a match. The game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among Indians, who were introduced to the sport by the early Mohammedan invaders in the 13th century. Did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Yet English plantation owners actually learned polo from locals in the Indian state of Assam in the 19th century. Later popularised by royalty, it became the sport of wealthy Englishmen. TEA . We all know the English love a good cuppa. A lot of people know that tea was first grown in China, which was then taken to India by the British. But did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Invented by tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in New York City in June 1908, they can now be found in virtually every one of Britain's  homes. But if it wasn't for a handful of confused Americans, the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all. They came about only after Mr Sullivan, in an attempt to cut costs, sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch-like purses. Unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag, the Americans dunked it into a cup of hot water. And so was born the tea bag. After complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine, Mr Sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today's tea bag design. But it was not until 1953, when British tea producer Tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag, that it began to take off here. The firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week. PUBS . Long have the British population relished a pint in the local pub, but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the Romans almost two thousand years ago. When they created the Roman road network, they opened little inns where a passer-by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination. Originally called Tabernae, they began selling food and wine as well as ale. After the departure of the Romans, Alehouses began opening up all over the country. Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD . ST GEORGE . Believe it or not, even Saint George himself is thought to have been born abroad during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD. Although historians have argued the Roman soldier's place of birth for over a century, it is believed that Saint George was born to a Greek Christian noble family in Syria. ENIGMA CODE . To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award-winning movie The Imitation Game starring Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch. But in 2012, the Polish Government launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. Poles claim that Polish code breakers in Warsaw were the first ones to break Germany’s Enigma code by understanding the mathematics, left. People from Liverpool, like the Rooneys, right, are often called 'Scousers', which is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port . In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw.

9875,"Human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time, according to scientists. Researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in China that has introduced DNA changes to reproductive cells. Although the scientific paper is yet to be published, the scientific world is abuzz with rumours that the work has been carried out. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren. Human embryos, like the one above, may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques . They say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications. They have described it as 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable'. However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. A gene editing technique known as CRISPR can search through DNA and replace specific genes or remove them. Under proposals put forward by Dr Luhan Yang, human ovarian tissue from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer could be used to obtain immature egg cells. These could then be encouraged to grow in the laboratory before using CRISPR to remove the genetic fault causing the cancer. The defective BRAC1 gene, for example, results in inherited breast and ovarian cancer. By repairing this gene, the resulting egg could be made healthy. Researchers at the moment say this should only be used for scientific research but it opens up the possibility of using edited eggs to create human embryos that have had heritable diseases removed. According to a report by the National Post, Professor George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, says a paper outlining the technology is due to be published. He said: 'There is a paper from China. I don't think it's been accepted yet, but I think it will be at some point.' His comments match those made by several leading scientists working with non-reproductive stem cells who have raised concerns over the new technology. Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases. Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations. Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China. A number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos. Germ line genetic editing alters the DNA in sperm and egg cells - meaning the changes can be passed on . Xingxu Huang, from Shanghai Tech University in China has been seeking permission to perform the technique on discarded human embryos after having successfully using it to modify monkey embryos that developed into live animals. Improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near '100 per cent efficiency' in trials using mice, a leading scientist has warned. Dr Tony Perry, a geneticist at the University of Bath, said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children. The warning follows a breakthrough last April in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living, adult mice using the Crispr-Cas9 gene editing technique. The Crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies. 'We used a pair of molecular scissors and a molecular sat nav that tells the scissors where to cut,' Dr Perry told James Gallagher at the BBC. 'It's a case of 'you shoot you score'...On the human side, one has to be very cautious.' Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the Crispr system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. Professor Church's own group is also said to be developing techniques that could be used to modify human embryos. Dr Luhan Yang, a scientist with Church's group, recently outlined proposals to edit the human germline in an interview with Technology Review. She proposed using immature egg cells from the ovaries taken from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. The immature egg would be grown and coaxed into dividing before a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR would be used to correct the genetic fault that was causing the ovarian cancer. However, the project is not thought to be underway yet and it is not known if it has been approved. Dr Yang, however, has been reported to have been involved in a similar project in China. Last month a leading group of biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on germ line research amid rumours that it had already been used to alter human embryos in China. Edward Lanphier, chairman of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in Washington DC, and four colleagues, wrote in the journal Nature that such research could harm other areas of science by provoking a public outcry. They wrote: 'It is thought that studies involving the use of genome-editing tools to modify the DNA of human embryos will be published shortly . 'In our view, genome editing in human embryos using current technologies could have unpredictable effects on future generations. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren . 'This makes it dangerous and ethically unacceptable. 'Such research could be exploited for non-therapeutic modifications. 'We are concerned that a public outcry about such an ethical breach could hinder a promising area of therapeutic development, namely making genetic changes that cannot be inherited. 'At this early stage, scientists should agree not to modify the DNA of human reproductive cells.' Their fears tap into concerns that such technology could be used to create 'designer families' where certain traits are selected for. In reality such selection can be difficult as often there is no single gene that provides a single trait and many genes have multiple functions.","Scientists in China are believed to have altered the DNA of human embryos so that changes can be passed on to future generations in the germ line .

2924,"A young man who has been stuck in the foster system since the day his mother gave birth to him behind bars has finally found a home. Davion Navar Henry Only, 16, became the face of adoption and an example of all the struggles faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up in a suit and told worshipers at Florida's St Mark Missionary Baptist Church; 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.' He then said; 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.' Most of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever.' Millions of people around the country soon head about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family. That is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system. Scroll down for video . Davion Only has been adopted by his old case worker, Connie Bell Going (above) Davion (above) captured hearts around the nation in 2013 when he made a plea in front of church congregation for a family to 'love him forever' This after Davion (abobe with Going) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children . Throughout Davion's search for a family, and his years in the system, Connie Bell Going, had been by his side. In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times she revealed that after Davion returned, people kept asking her what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months. She said wanted to tell these people; 'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong.' Making matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida. Davion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year. Going says she had begun to call him numerous times, but always hung up the phone. Then, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy. 'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said. 'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?' For the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear. The 52-year-old had three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier. From August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Tyler. Then, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. Davion (above) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July . 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion (above in 2013) said to Going last December . Davion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' Going is set to officially become Davion's mother on April 22, and she will admit it has not been an easy task. There is fighting and tables get flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges. Davion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their birthdays, which fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers. After 16 years Davion was finally home. What's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well.","Davion Only, 16, captured hearts around the nation in 2013 when he made a plea in front of church congregation for a family to 'love him forever'

4156,"Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood has offered encouragement to a six-year-old fan he beat to the job. Charlie Pye, from Leamington Spa, applied for the Villa hotseat after Paul Lambert was sacked in February. The Villa fan wanted a chocolate bar as a win bonus and would have agreed terms for a signed claret and blue football, a WWE wrestling figure and some sweets. Sherwood wrote Charlie a letter congratulating him on his credentials, despite missing out on the job. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood (centre) showed his softer side by replying to 6-year-old Charlie Pye . He wrote: 'From your letter it is clear to see that you would indeed be an ideal candidate for the job due to your knowledge of the game - and your very capable backroom staff, of course! 'Hopefully you're not too disappointed at missing out and I'm informed that I just managed to pip you to the post so you were very close to being offered the job. 'Our chief executive Tom Fox has informed me that the club would like your permission to keep the letter on file 'just in case' - although I'm hoping I will be successful at this great football club. The youngster applied for the role when Paul Lambert was sacked but was pipped to the post by Sherwood . 'I will certainly be aiming to make you and all the other supporters happy. 'In terms of your football career, I want to wish Norton Lindsey every success this season. Well done on being appointed captain. I was a captain during my own playing career - it's a special honour.' Sherwood has guided Villa six points above the relegation zone in the Barclays Premier League after Saturday's 1-0 win at former club Tottenham and taken them to Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Charlie had written to chief executive Tom Fox after Lambert was sacked with Villa in the relegation zone earlier this year. Pye is captain of Norton Lindsey and got a special message from Sherwood about being a captain . He wrote: 'I would appoint my mum and dad as assistant managers so they can drive me to the training ground each day. My mum is also very good at making bacon sandwiches for the players if that helps.' Charlie told the club's official site: 'I never expected a letter from the manager but I was absolutely delighted to get one. 'What he wrote was brilliant - it meant a lot to me. Even the stuff about congratulating me on being a captain was really special.'

10181,"Officers who rushed to the scene of the Colorado theater shooting entered a hellish world of bloody victims, noxious smells and blaring sounds - a gloomy darkness pierced by bright flashes from a fire alarm, police testified Wednesday. 'It was dim, the movie was still playing, the alarm was going off,' Aurora police officer Annette Brook told jurors in the trial of gunman James Holmes. 'I began to notice the bodies, the live victims, the blood.' Prosecutors called Brook and two other officers as witnesses on Wednesday, and their descriptions of the chaos of inside the suburban Denver theater intensified the already disturbing scene described a day earlier by moviegoers who were badly wounded or saw loved ones gunned down in the July 20, 2012, attack. Scroll down for video . The third day of the trial against suspected Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes continued on Wednesday. If convicted, Holmes could be sentenced to death. Pictured above in court on Monday, far left . Twelve people were killed and 70 hurt when Holmes allegedly opened fire on a packed theater in Aurora, Colorado for a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises in July 2012. Above, the scene of the theater after the shooting . Twelve people died and 70 were wounded. Holmes is charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. He admits he was the shooter, his defense attorneys say, but schizophrenia had taken control of his mind and compelled him to kill. His lawyers are asking the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity, which would send him to the state mental hospital indefinitely. Prosecutors argue Holmes was sane and fully aware that what he was doing was wrong. They want the jury to convict him and sentence him to die. Holmes' defense attorneys want the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors say Holmes knew what he was doing, however. On the left, a sketch of Holmes in court on Monday and and 2012 mugshot on the right . In the opening days of the trial, prosecutors have appeared intent on planting a deeply upsetting image in the jurors' minds. 'It smelled very, very bad,' officer Tomas Campagna testified Wednesday, describing the mixed odors of blood, sweat, urine and feces. 'It's hard to imagine unless you've been there.' Spent cartridges and casings from a shotgun, a rifle and a handgun littered the ground, so thick that officers couldn't avoid stepping on them, Campagna said. In places, the floor looked like it had been painted in blood, he said. Cellphones left behind by the victims rang far into the night. More victims testified Wednesday, describing the booms and the brilliant flashes of light that burst from the muzzles of the weapons aimed at them and the hot pain of being shot. One of those victims was Joshua Nowlan, a former member of the military who worked on aircraft carriers. He went to the movie, 'The Dark Knight Rises,' at the Century 16 multiplex in the Denver suburb of Aurora with friends who had just returned from their honeymoon in Florida. About 15 or 20 minutes into the film, a tear gas canister was thrown into the theater, and then the shooting started. Nowlan, who shielded his friends from the bullets, was shot twice and has undergone multiple surgeries. He used the cane he now needs to walk to show jurors what he saw next. 'I assumed it had to be the shooter, from his stance ... He was walking around, and I can see him pointing the gun in a circular motion that looked like he was searching for more people ... I was terribly scared,' Nowlan told the court. 'My thought process was that he was searching for other people and that he was going to start going row by row, and that anybody he would see in that row who was still moving, he would shoot.' He described the shooter firing three-round bursts. Asked if the gunman moved fast or methodically, Nowlan said: 'He was definitely moving slowly.' None of the victims said they saw Holmes' face, but one of the police officers did. Sgt. Spc. Gerald Jonsgaard testified he saw Holmes lying on the ground in the parking lot outside the theater as two officers arrested him. Jonsgaard didn't identify Holmes by name Wednesday but said he was sitting at the defense table. Holmes' lawyers have not cross-examined any prosecution witnesses. They will call their own witnesses after the prosecution rests.","Victims of the 2012 Colorado movie theater shooting testified in court on Wednesday as the trial of suspect James Holmes continued .

Vocativ reported that at least 7 per cent of them listed Baghdad, Iraq as their hometown, a larger number than any U.S. city. That would represent more than 46,000 people. Additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her U.S. Facebook fans are older than 55, most of the Baghdad contingent is in the 18-34 age range.

2801,"She might be celebrating her 75th birthday, but an overjoyed Queen Margrethe of Denmark looked far younger as she waved to excited crowds from the balcony at the Amalienborg Palace. The Danish monarch was joined on the balcony by her sons, Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and Prince Joachim, 45, who were with her again for a procession down Copenhagen shopping street Strøget to the Københavns Rådhus [city hall] for a slap-up lunch. And the two were by Margrethe's side once again in the evening when the Danish royals welcomed royals from all corners of Europe to Fredensborg Castle for a gala banquet followed by a magnificent fireworks display.

Smart: Denmark's Princess Marie and Prince Joachim were next to arrive with Prince Joachim wearing a striking red velvet tuxedo . Smart: Denmark's Princess Marie chose a floor-length ivory dress covered in delicate beads . Joining them was Frederik's Australian-born wife Mary, 43, who opted for a striking silver gown featuring a neat high neckline and dramatic blouson sleeves. Margrethe's other daughter-in-law, the French-born Princess Marie, 39, was also at Fredensborg and looked wonderful in a floor-length cream beaded gown. Other members of the Danish Royal Family to attend the event included Margrethe's sister Princess Benedikte, 70, who chose a summery floral dress with a square neck and sheer train. As with Wednesday night's lavish dinner at Christiansborg Palace, Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt  was on the guest list and cut a dramatic figure in a heavily sequinned black and nude dress. But while socialist politician Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is married to former Labour MP Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, caught the eye, it was the many royals in attendance who took centre stage.

Stunning: The 262-year-old castle, which was built by Frederik IV, was lit up by the flashes from the exploding fireworks . From Sweden came the country's King Carl XVI Gustaf and his glamorous Brazilian-born wife Silvia, who arrived with Crown Princess Victoria, 37, who looked ravishing in a spectacular sequinned dress. The Norwegian Royal Family was represented by dashing Crown Prince Haakon, 41, who had arrived in the Danish capital earlier that day to mark Queen Margrethe's birthday alongside his wife, the ice blonde Crown Princess Mette-Marit. Margrethe's birthday celebrations had kicked off with a touching family wake-up call, which saw Margrethe's two sons and their families join crowned heads from the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg to sing traditional Danish folk songs beneath her window. Next on her agenda was an appearance on the balcony of the Amalienborg Palace alongside her son and heir, Crown Prince Frederik, 46, his wife Crown Princess Mary, 43, and their four children. Waiting below was an enormous flag-waving crowd who went into raptures as the royals appeared, watched by members of other European royal dynasties, among them Sweden's and Norway's. Also on the balcony was Margrethe's second son, Joachim, 45, his French wife Princess Marie, his children from his first marriage, Nikolai, 15, and Felix, 12, and his youngest two, Henrik, five, Athena, three. One royal who couldn't be present on the balcony or for the gala dinner at Fredensborg that followed was Margrethe's 80-year-old husband Prince Henrik who, according to palace officials, is suffering from flu. The French-born royal also missed the carriage procession down Copenhagen shopping street Strøget to the Rådhus and was replaced for the day by his son Frederik. Royal wave: Queen Margrethe is flanked by her sons Frederik and Joachim as she waves to the crowds . Celebrating: Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik, his wife Mary and their nine-year-old son Prince Christian on the balcony .

Four-year-old Vincent appeared more interested in scaling the balcony rails . What's going on? Prince Christian grimaces at something in the crowd during his grandmother's birthday celebrations . Despite being without Prince Henrik, the appearance proved a cheerful affair - largely thanks to the antics of four-year-old Prince Vincent, who did his best to scale the railings of the balcony. Held back by his father, the youngster smiled mischievously and was quickly copied by his twin sister Josephine - much to their mother Princess Mary's amusement. Australian-born Mary, who was elegant in a navy ensemble topped with a grey cocktail hat, certainly appeared to be enjoying the moment, smiling broadly as she stood with her four children. Frederik, meanwhile, was content to wave to the crowd and at one point leaned down to whisper in the ear of his older son, nine-year-old Prince Christian. Girls together: Prince Joachim holds his three-year-old daughter Athena, while Crown Princess Mary clutches four-year-old Josephine . Overjoyed: Queen Margrethe, who was without her husband Prince Henrik, appeared overcome . Saying thank you: Margrethe, who was resplendent in a turquoise ensemble, waved to the crowds . Saying hello: The Danish royals toured Copenhagen following the balcony appearance . Enjoying the day: Denmark's Princess Marie, Crown Princess Mary and Queen Margrethe wave to the crowds outside the Amalienborg Palace . Enjoying the ride: Margrethe and Mary sat opposite each other during the procession along Strøget . Pomp: The royals were followed down main shopping street Strøget by a detachment of guards .

3417,"Pusok sported a black eye in his booking photo after the beating . A California county on Tuesday approved paying a $650,000 settlement to avoid a lawsuit by a man whose beating by deputies after a horse chase was captured on video. San Bernardino County spokesman David Wert said county supervisors approved the settlement with 30-year-old Francis Pusok in a closed meeting. Pusok's arrest was recorded by a TV news helicopter and has led to an FBI civil rights investigation and 10 deputies being placed on leave pending an internal probe. Wert says the agreement would settle all potential claims from Pusok's April 9 arrest. A message seeking comment was left for Pusok's lawyer. In an interview with NBC 4,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for '99 per cent' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear: 'This isn't over.' When San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies arrived at Pusok's house, he said he  fled 'because any contact with police has been negative for me'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach. A California county has approved a $650,000 settlement to avoid a lawsuit from Pusok after his beating by deputies after a horse chase was captured on video . Pusok's arrest was recorded by a TV news helicopter and led to an FBI civil rights investigation and 10 deputies being placed on leave pending an internal probe . The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled 'stop resisting' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops 'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.' 'I thought I was being beaten to death,' said Pusok.. 'I was wondering, ""When is it going to stop?""' After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident were placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok's lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon told reporters he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video . Deputies have been called to Pusok's home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said. However, Pusok's pregnant girlfriend, Jolene Bindner, says some of the prior charges against her longtime partner have been trumped up. Bindner told NBC that the charges he threatened to kill a police officer are 'absolutely not true. I was there the whole time.'","County supervisors approved the settlement with 30-year-old Francis Pusok in a closed meeting .

7647,"Police in Georgia say a man shot an armadillo, but ended up accidentally wounding his 74-year-old mother-in-law when the bullet ricocheted off the animal's shell. Lee County Sheriff's deputies said that 54-year-old Larry McElroy fired his 9mm pistol at the animal on Sunday night when he saw the vermin in his Leesburg backyard. While one bullet killed the armadillo, deputies say another bounced off the armored animal, hit a fence, traveled through the back door of the mother-in-law's mobile home and the recliner she was sitting in and struck her in the back. According to police reports, McElroy fired 100-yards away from Johnson's home. Accident: Larry McElroy shot Carol Johnson on Sunday night after he tried to kill an armadillo in his backyard . McElroy's mother-in-law, Carol Johnson suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was talking all the way to the hospital. 'Just the circumstances, just all the way around, the whole situation was unusual,' said Investigator Bill Smith to WALB.Com. 'She was walking around on her own power and talking,' said Smith. 'It didn't appear to be too severe. They took her to Phoebe North hospital.' Unusual: Lee County Sheriff's investigator, Bill Smith advised Mr. McElroy to use a shotgun the next time he wanted to kill an armadillo . Battle hardened: Armadillo's are known for their armored shells which protect them in the wild against bears and wild cats .

4234,"Saudi Arabia has been condemned for beheading an Indonesian domestic worker who was 'suffering from mental illness'. Her home country's leadership is furious that Siti Zainab's family was not notified before her execution this morning - and summoned Saudi Arabia's ambassador to complain about her death. While Amnesty International says her killing in the holy Islamic city of Media this morning 'smacks of a basic lack of humanity'. The domestic worker was sentenced to death in 1999 after confessing to stabbing her employer who allegedly mistreated her to death. She was on death row for over 15 years while Saudi Arabian authorities waited for the victim's youngest child to reach adulthood - to decide whether or not the family wanted to pardon Zainab or demand her execution. Executed: Indonesia and human rights groups are furious that Saudi Arabia executed domestic worker Siti Zainab without notifying the country's officials or her family . Indonesian President Joko Widodo and three of his predecessors had previously written to the Saudi king asking for the victim's family to forgive Zainab. But the sentence was carried out despite their claims that Zainab's family and officials were not given adequate notice or information before she was killed. Indonesia's foreign ministry released a statement saying: 'From the beginning, the government has struggled to provide her with assistance and has asked the family [of the victim] for forgiveness. 'The Indonesian government filed a protest against the Saudi Arabian government for not giving prior notification to Indonesian representatives or to the family over the execution date.' Riyadh's ambassador to Indonesia  was 'surprised' to be summoned by the foreign ministry but said he would follow up on Jakarta's concerns. Mustafa Ibrahim Al-Mubarak said: 'The problem is not about the court and the execution, it is about the date of the execution... I have to check what went wrong.' Before her arrest, Zainab sent two separate letters to her employer's son to say the woman she eventually killed had been cruel to her. The Indonesian government has issued a statement condemning Saudi Arabian authorities' failure to notify them and Zainab's family before executing her. Desperate plee: Indonesian President Joko Widodo had previously written to the Saudi king asking for the Saudi victim's family to forgive Zainab . A UN resolution has urged states not to execute or impose the death penalty 'on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder'. 'Imposing the death penalty and executing someone with a suspected mental illness smacks of a basic lack of humanity,' according to Amnestry International's Middle East and North Africa Programme Director. Philip Luther added: 'This practice has been widely condemned on the world stage and Saudi Arabia should take this opportunity to reconsider its stance on the death penalty.' She had no legal representation at any stage and did not have access to a consular representative during the police interrogation when she had made her 'confession', according to Amnesty. They claim the police knew she suffered from mental illness at the time of the interrogation. The charity's 2014 global report on the death penalty released earlier this month said Saudi Arabia once again ranks among the top five executioners in the world. So far in 2015, Saudi Arabia has executed at least 60 people, most of them by beheading which compares to 90 executions in the entirety of 2014. Philip Luther added: 'Whatever the misguided purpose behind Saudi Arabia's shocking spike in executions so far this year, it should draw international condemnation. 'The Kingdom's authorities must halt this execution spree and establish an official moratorium on the use of the death penalty.' Human rights groups are using Zainab's beheading to urge Indonesia to abandon its support for the death penalty as it presses ahead with plans to execute several foreigners on death row for drug crimes. But Jakarta remains determined to execute several drug traffickers - including citizens from Australia, France, Nigeria, Ghana, Brazil and the Philippines - as soon as possible.","Siti Zainab was executed in holy city of Medina after 15 years on death row .

6694,"A woman who allegedly dumped her quadriplegic son in the woods so she could spend the week with her out-of-state boyfriend is now facing an attempted murder charge, police have said. Nyia Parler, 41, has been hospitalized for undisclosed reasons in Maryland ever since her 21-year-old son was found in a pile of wet leaves in Cobb Creek Park in Philadelphia last Friday. Police believe the man had been left in the woods all week - with nothing but a bible and a blanket - and was exposed to the rain and cold and to wild animals. He was found next to his wheelchair. Parler was initially charged with aggravated assault, kidnapping and neglect of a care-dependent person, and police have now added attempted murder to the list. Accused: Nyia Parler, 41, who is in hospital for undisclosed reasons, now faces an attempted murder charge for allegedly dumping her disabled son, 21, in the rainy and cold woods for five days . Charged: Parler (right) left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left), right. Ferguson thought that other relatives were looking after the son, while Parler told relatives the boy was with her . Police said they did not expect to arrest Parler until she was cleared for release from the hospital and charged in Maryland as a fugitive. They would then seek to have her extradited. Captain Paul Starks of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department in Maryland said on Monday that security reasons prevented him from disclosing the name of the facility where Parler is being held and medical privacy laws prevented him from discussing Parler's health condition. The last time the mother and son were seen together was on Easter Sunday. She then allehedly boarded a bus to visit her new boyfriend, John Ferguson, in Maryland, authorities said. She told concerned relatives last week that she had taken her son with her when she went to visit her boyfriend, who thought that family members were watching the son, police said. But the son attends a public high school that had inquired about his absences, they said. Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother . Abandoned: A passerby saw the 21-year-old's wheelchair and found the man after going to investigate . Investigation: Officers recovered the man's wheelchair (pictured) for evidence after he was found alone . Relatives, who had been contacted by the boy's school when he didn't turn up to class, commented on Parler's Facebook page, 'nyia call me asap,' and 'How the hell you happy?!? Call me!' The son, who has cerebral palsy, was found around the corner from his home by a person who saw the wheelchair and went to investigate. If the person hadn't done that, Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker said, 'this kid would have died a miserable death'. The son was in stable condition at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on Monday after being treated for dehydration, malnutrition and abrasions, Walker said. 'This kid is obviously a fighter,' Walker told ABC. 'It's just unbelievable how we found him last night. It's just heartbreaking to see how another human, especially a mother, could treat him like that.'","Nyia Parler 'left her son in the woods in Philadelphia so that she could spend the week with her boyfriend in Maryland'

7583,"An Indian salesman is facing seven years in prison and a fine of up to one million dirham - around £186,000 - for allegedly cursing Islam and the Prophet Mohammad on Facebook. The 41-year-old man - identified only by his initials S.G. - is said to have posted a 'blasphemous' status on his Facebook page after watching a news bulletin about the war in Iraq on television last July. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to seven years in jail, a fine of between Dh250,000 to Dh1 million, or both. The Indian salesman faces imprisonment after he allegedly shared a 'blasphemous' status on his Facebook page. He told police he was sent the image over Whatsapp, but allegedly then admitted to posting the status . The 41-year-old is accused by the prosecution of posting the derogatory statements about Islam and the Prophet Mohammad after watching a news item about the Iraq war, pictured, in July last year . Lawyers for the prosecution said the man abused the social media network - namely Facebook - and the telephone communication system by cursing the Prophet and Islam, according to Gulf News. They are now looking for the toughest punishment possible under the country's cyber-crime laws. Islam is the official religion of the United Arab Emirates, and committing blasphemy is considered deeply offensive. Authorities in the country routinely censor newspapers and books that they consider contain blasphemous statements or anything critical of Islam. In the latest case, the accused salesman claimed he received the offending image over Whatsapp while he was at home . He then complained to police that he had receiving the image - but is reported to have later admitted to prosecutors that he was the one who posted the status on Facebook. The Indian employee, known only by his initials S.G., failed to attend the hearing at the Dubai Court of First Instance on Monday. The United Arab Emirates treats blasphemy as a serious criminal offence . The defendant apparently told prosecutors that he wrote the 'blasphemous' curses after watching video footage about the way in Iraq. His IPhone was seized and sent to a laboratory for forensic examination, and lawyers said the mobile was registered to the indian man's name. The accused failed to attend the Dubat Court of First Instance on Monday, and presiding judge Abdul Lat adjourned the case until the next hearing on April 27. In 2011 British tourist Andrew Graham ended up in court in Dubai after he called the Islamic prophet Mohammad a 'terrorist' during an argument in a shopping centre.","Indian man, 41, accused of posting insulting status about Islamic Prophet .

3294,"The vaccine, known as RTS,S, took 30 years to develop but it is now hoped it can be used to save millions of lives . A new jab against malaria could prevent millions of cases, scientists claim. Researchers say the vaccine, which has just completed the final stages of testing, could make a ‘substantial contribution’ to controlling the disease. Drug firm GlaxoSmithKline has applied for a licence from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the RTS,S vaccine. The news is significant because RTS,S is the first malaria vaccine to reach advanced trials. Tests were carried out on 15,500 toddlers and babies in sub-Saharan Africa. Among those who had three doses of RTS,S and a booster shot, the number of clinical cases of malaria – those confirmed by a doctor – was reduced by 36 per cent after four years. But the protection waned over time, boosters worked less well than the initial dose and the vaccine was not as effective in younger children, a report in The Lancet journal says. Scientists have worked on the vaccine for more than 20 years – at a cost of more than £330million, but experts say there is a long way to go. There is no licensed vaccine against malaria anywhere in the world and researchers say they are hopeful the results will be sufficient for RTS,S to gain a licence from the EMA.The World Health Organisation could then recommend its use by October this year. In the trials, an average of 1,363 cases of clinical malaria were prevented over four years for every 1,000 children vaccinated, and 1,774 cases in those who also received a booster. Over three years, an average 558 cases were averted for every 1,000 infants vaccinated, and 983 cases in those also given a booster dose. Professor Brian Greenwood, the study’s author and professor of clinical tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ‘Despite the falling efficacy over time, there is still a clear benefit from RTS,S. ‘Given that there were an estimated 198million malaria cases in 2013, this level of efficacy potentially translates into millions of cases of malaria in children being prevented.’ But he said he was ‘disappointed’ by the results of the clinical trials, adding: ‘I hoped the vaccine would be more effective, but we were never going to end up with the success seen in measles vaccines, with 97 per cent efficacy.’ The shot , which is designed to be used by children in Africa, could be approved by October, making it the first approved vaccine for the world's most deadly disease . The disease is difficult to treat because the malaria parasite has a complicated life cycle and has learned how to evade the human immune system over hundreds of years. The latest World Health Organisation figures show that of the 198million cases in 2013, 584,000 people died. Most victims are children in Africa, where one dies every minute. Currently, the most effective prevention measure is the use of mosquito nets. The trial involved 15,459 infants aged six to 12 weeks and children aged five to 17 months from Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. Bloodsucker: A mosquito. Only female mosquitos can transmit malaria .","Vaccine named RTS,S could be available by October, scientists believe .

The Gunners tackle the leaders aiming to eat into their 10-point advantage at the top of the table following last weekend's 1-0 victory over third-placed Manchester United. Coquelin was drafted back into the Arsenal squad from a loan spell at Charlton in December, since when the 23-year-old has gone on to cement his place in shielding the back four, and has been instrumental during a run of 21 victories from the last 25 matches. Francis Coquelin has made 23 appearances for Arsenal this season since ending his loan spell at Charlton . Coquelin is looking forward to his duel with Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic on Sunday at the Emirates . The Frenchman, though, knows he will be up against one of the best defensive midfielders around when the Serb Matic aims to close out another triumph for Jose Mourinho's men. 'What he has done is unbelievable. At Chelsea he is one of the main men, so credit to him. He has had a great season and is a great player. It is always good to play against players like that,' Coquelin said on Arsenal Player. 'It is an important position and Matic has shown how important he is - that is what I am trying to do as well for Arsenal. 'The fans want a good defensive midfielder - they know it is important for the team.' Arsenal will be out to beat Chelsea for the first time since October 2011, when Robin van Persie netted a hat-trick in a remarkable 5-3 victory at Stamford Bridge. Coquelin played against Reading in the FA Cup semi-final last weekend and has cemented his place in the side . Wenger, though, has every confidence his side can again answer another stern examination. 'From a good run of form you get a good belief and we have a good solidarity,' he said. 'We know that we have passed many tests recently where we were questioned. This season is the first time we have won away from home against Manchester City [in a while]. 'So we have passed many tests and we have another on Sunday that we want to pass.' Wenger added: 'Chelsea have been very, very efficient on counter-attacks, very efficient on set-pieces as well, so to nullify their strengths will be important.'","Francis Coquelin ready for head-to-head battle with Nemanja Matic .

Having won last year’s race on Pineau De Re, 38-year-old Leighton Aspell, who once walked away from the sport for 18 months after becoming disillusioned, became the first rider since Bryan Marshall, who won on Royal Tan and Early Mist in 1953 and 1954, to land the biggest jumps race of the year in successive years on different horses. How grateful he is now that that spell away recharged his batteries. Many Clouds was a third winner of the race for owner Trevor Hemmings. The man who owns both Blackpool Tower and Preston North End has also won the race with Hedgehunter in 2005 and Ballabriggs in 2011. Many Clouds, ridden by Leighton Aspell, jumps a fence on the way to winning the Grand National at Aintree . AP McCoy on Shutthefrontdoor (left) congratulates Aspell after Many Clouds' victory on Saturday . While the gelding, whose participation in the race had been in doubt after his disappointing sixth in the Cheltenham Gold Cup last month, also provided a massive change of National luck for his Lambourn trainer Oliver Sherwood. None of his four previous runners in the race had managed to complete the course and two of them — 1988 favourite Sacred Path and Eric’s Charm in 2010 — had fallen at the first fence. Many Clouds passed the line one-and-three-quarter lengths in front of Tom George-trained 33-1 shot Saint Are, with 40-1 chance Monbeg Dude running a massive race in third for his trainer Michael Scudamore and his trio of former international rugby-playing owners Mike Tindall, James Simpson- Daniel and Nicky Robinson. In fourth for the second year running was Fergal O’Brien’s Alvarado, whose finishing position meant jockey Paul Moloney has remarkably been placed seven times in the race. But he never had a chance to lay a glove on Aspell and Many Clouds, who had struck for home well before the home straight. One of the first to congratulate the winning jockey was McCoy. Aspell said: ‘He is as good in defeat as he is when he is winning. I think the only people here happy he has been beaten are me and Andrew Cooper [the supremo at Sandown where McCoy will now end his career on April 25]. I can’t imagine what this place would have been like if he had won. ‘Last year I had to work hard at certain points of the race and I was a very tired man at the end but this time it was very smooth.’ Winning jockey Aspell holds up the Grand National trophy as the 38-year-old celebrates a famous victory . Many Clouds won the National for trainer Oliver Sherwood (centre) and last year's winning jockey Aspell . If Aspell was not fatigued, his mount certainly was and Many Clouds had to be dismounted on the track on welfare grounds to aid a speedy recovery in the wash-down area. He was later paraded in front of the grandstands after the final race of the day. Resurgent trainer Sherwood, whose wife Tarnya rode Numerate and pulled up in the 1989 race, added: ‘He was foot-perfect, I don’t think that he made a mistake. ‘I thought that the race was a year too soon and Trevor knows that. It was his decision to run. ‘It wasn’t my decision, so he must get all the credit, not me. I am in cloud cuckoo land.’ “To this day, I don’t know what happened in the Gold Cup - he didn’t run his race. ‘Something wasn’t right that day, maybe he got out of bed the wrong side. ‘I have done nothing with him since the Gold Cup, just literally one school and he hasn’t seen a National fence on purpose. All we have done just to freshen him up.’ Nineteen of the 39 starters finished the race and all horses emerged unscathed, although Balthazar King was still under veterinary observation last night after a heavy fall at the first Canal Turn which caused the fence to be bypassed by the field on the second circuit. Aspell, riding  Many Clouds (right), goes toe-to-toe with second placed Saint Are (centre) along the final straight . Last year's winning jockey Aspell celebrates his victory as Many Clouds slows to a halt after the race . Early exits included Al Co, one of three to get no further than the first fence, and Unioniste, who fell at the fifth. If there was an unlucky horse in the race it had to be The Druids Nephew, who was bowling along powerfully in the lead under Aidan Coleman when falling at the 26th fence. By then the writing was on the wall for well-backed 8-1 shot Rocky Creek, who faded into 17th, and last year’s winner Pineau de Re, this time ridden to 12th place by Daryl Jacob. But there still seemed a big chance of glory for McCoy, who had positioned Shutthefrontdoor close behind the leaders throughout. McCoy said: ‘He ran a blinder. I was delighted with him. He was just a little fresh and didn’t get home.’ The Aintree course, packed to the rafters with 72,000 fans, has been the backdrop to some remarkable stories in its long history and many had arrived in this suburb of Liverpool with both hope and expectations of witnessing a piece of sporting folklore unfolding. Winning horse Many Clouds is doused with water shortly after winning the Grand National in Liverpool . Many Clouds (far right) leaps over the water jump during the Grand National at Aintree on Saturday afternoon . The mass plunge predicted by the bookmakers on McCoy’s mount didn’t quite materialise and his failure to secure the 4,348th victory of his career on the Jonjo O’Neill-trained 6-1 favourite saved the bookmakers up to £50 million.They had predicted successful McCoy and Shuthefrontdoor, carrying the money of thousands of once-a-year punters would cost them in the region of £50million. There had even been speculation that some firms might have been so dented by the avalanche of bets on the retiring hero that they will have to issue profit warning come Monday morning. Instead of profit warnings being issued on Monday morning, the sound of popping champagne corks will be echoing around boardrooms. Dave Stevens of Coral said: ‘The victory of Many Clouds would certainly have been cheered by some punters, but we have absolutely no complaints about the result, and would place it in the “very good” category.’ A disappointed McCoy after finishing fifth in his final Grand National before retiring . McCoy opens the newly named McCoy's bar before the race on Saturday . Before racing, McCoy, inducted into the Aintree Hall of Fame on Thursday, had been honoured when the bar created out of the old weighing room was renamed in his honour. On Saturday may not have gone to script but, for years to come in McCoy’s, they will toast the patron saint of punters and his never-say-die attitude. Plenty would argue his achievements make him worthy of mention in the same breath as the great Australian batsman Sir Don Bradman, who, back in 1948, needed to score only four runs in his final Test innings to end with a batting average of 100. He was out for a second-ball duck — an example of just how hard it is to script the perfect denouement. Driving away from Aintree last night, the great McCoy will have known exactly how The Don must have felt.","Cloud Nine ridden by Leighton Aspell won the Grand National at Aintree .

8209,"A Massachusetts man was arrested after police found two homes full of bomb-making materials. Joseph T. Brennan Jr. of Norwell tried to hide from the cameras as he was arraigned from his hospital bed on Monday, pleading not guilty to possession of an infernal device. This after authorities searched the residences following an incident on Saturday night in which Brennan accidentally blew up his car while smoking a cigarette and police discovered 'various bomb-making components.' Scroll down for video . Joseph T. Brennan Jr. (above) of Norwell, Massachusetts was found with a home full of bomb-making materials . Police searched the home after an incident Saturday night where Brennan blew up his car (above) while smoking a cigarette near gun powder . 'I’m an idiot. I lit a cigarette with the gunpowder in the front seat,' Brennan said in the police report according to the Boston Herald. The blast left the man with minor injuries and he was admitted to Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Brennan, with singed eyebrows and bandaged hands, said he did not want to be on ""TV"" as he was being arraigned Monday afternoon, trying to hide his face and singed eyebrows with a towel. In addition to Brennan's home in Norwell, the condo of Benjamin Young in Hingham was also found to be full of bomb-making devices. Police have not revealed at this time the relationship between the two men. Hazardous materials team responded to both locations and were able to remove and safely detonate some of the materials. Authorities do not believe the two men had any ties to terrorism. Brennan, who called himself an 'idiot' after blowing up his car, was arraigned from his hospital bed on Monday . Police searched the car Saturday night and seized 14 different substances . Just last month, Brennan posted a video to his Facebook page that showed what he claimed was rocket propellant being used to melt snow. He wrote; 'When people say it's not rocket science I get disappointed here's a variation of solid rocket propellant used in the retired space shuttles solid rocket boosters I think I'm in the wrong profession.' A witness to Saturday's car accident told police they heard a loud explosion and saw Brennan laying on the road as his car rolled towards a guardrail. Brennan then got up and gathered some materials and put them in his trunk according to the witness. Police searched the vehicle after noticing how burned Brennan was, and according to the police report he told officers on the scene when they found the materials; 'I got them from a friend to fu*k around with. I wasn’t going to do anything malicious.' ABC 5 reports that among the substances found in the car were potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide and acetone and containers full of sodium chlorate, picric acid and sulfur. Brennan, 36, will be charged with possession of a destructive device, and one part possession of components capable of making a component device, while Young, 27, is facing charges for being in possession of illegal possession of bomb-making materials. No members of the public were ever in danger according to police and it does not appear that these materials were intended to be used to hurt any individuals.","Joseph T.

393,"The Duchess of Cambridge is already up to four days overdue with her second child - and her labour could now be induced this week, it was claimed today. The 33-year-old royal’s baby is expected before the end of April - with the due date initially reported as yesterday, but later claimed to actually be as early as Wednesday last week. Either way Kate - who plans to give birth at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London - is now overdue and may have already spoken to doctors about the possibility of being induced. Scroll down for video . Previous royal birth: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London, in a proud moment with their newborn  son Prince George in July 2013 . Due date: Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital (pictured yesterday) for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . A source, whose children were born at the hospital’s exclusive Lindo Wing, told Daily Telegraph reporter Gordon Rayner: ‘The doctors don’t normally wait for more than a week. ‘They will probably already have been in touch with Kate, and talked about which day which suit her best to go in and be induced if the baby doesn’t arrive in the next couple of days.’ A Kensington Palace source said last week: 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date.'  Prince George was reportedly born three days late when he arrived at the hospital in July 2013. The joint favourite dates for the royal baby to be born are tomorrow and Tuesday at 6/1 - with Wednesday priced at 7/1 and Thursday 8/1, according to MailOnline's official betting partner Coral. The bookmaker is also offering evens on a morning birth, 3/1 on the baby arriving in the afternoon and 2/1 on it being in the evening – while Alice (5/4) and Charlotte (5/1) are the favourite names.

Cute: Prince William and Kate pose with their son Prince George at the National History Museum in London . But some punters might look further ahead for their bets - if they believe those who say labour is influenced by the lunar cycle and the arrival of a full moon. The next full moon is on May 4. The idea is the moon's gravitational pull affects the amniotic fluid in the same way it affects water in the sea and rivers. When Kate gave birth  on July 22, 2013, it was the day of a new full moon. Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron has defended William and Kate for opting to use private health services rather than the NHS. Asked if he was disappointed the Royal Family did not use the NHS, Mr Cameron told Sky News today: ‘I think it's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies. All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country.’ Around one in five deliveries in the UK is assisted. A Danish study in February suggested inducing women at 37 weeks can lower the chance of a baby dying or developing a serious health condition.","Due date believed to have been between last Wednesday and yesterday .

2758,"A young fashion designer who needed 26 stitches to her face after it was allegedly smashed into a glass table-top by a police officer is suing him and his force for $4million. Ariana Mason, 21, claims she was also choked by the man when he put her in a 'stranglehold' at a Las Vegas hotel. After filing a civil rights lawsuit against Officer Shawn Izzo and the Metropolitan Police Department,, she told reporters yesterday: 'What happened to me was wrong and I don't want it to happen to anybody else.' Scroll down for video . Tearful: Ariana Mason, 21, relives her ordeal to reporters yesterday. Scars said to be from the attack on her by a police officer last summer can be seen on her chin. Two of her teeth were also broken, she says . Ariana was flanked by her parents, Fred and Francina Mason of Teaneck, New Jersey, plus an aunt from Los Angeles - TV personality Rolonda Watts - and her lawyer Brent Bryson as she relived her ordeal. It was caught on CCTV cameras at The Mirage hotel casino on Las Vegas's strip. According to Ariana's lawsuit, she was subjected to excessive force at the hotel while she was being arrested shortly before 3am on August 16 last year. The lawsuit also noted that Ariana is African-American and Izzo is white. Ariana, who cried while talking to reporters yesterday, told them: 'I just feel as if the color of my skin was different, this wouldn't have happened to me.' Sombre: Ariana looks on as her lawyer holds up a photograph from last August of her battered face . Lawyer Brent Bryson said his young client had 26 stitches after her face was rammed into a glass table-top . Ariana Mason's aunt is Rolonda Watts, the television and radio talk show host. She is best known for hosting the eponymous Rolonda, an internationally syndicated talk show which aired from 1994 to 1997 . With scars clearly visible on her chin, she recalled how she had been at an event at The Mirage's 1 Oak nightclub – where her boyfriend 'DJ Tech' was performing. After his set, several people left the club to take pictures in front of the event's signage, according to Ariana's account. But during the photo session, a scuffle broke out 'between people associated with the event and security officers'. Ariana, who was wearing a black dress at the time, claims one of her girlfriends was 'attacked' by a woman security officer. Ariana said she grabbed the woman's jacket to move her away. But then Ariana herself was 'attacked' by Officer Izzo, who approached her from behind. Without warning, she says, he pulled her away and wrapped his forearm around her throat. In the hotel's CCTV footage, Ariana can be seen being restrained by a police officer, said to be Shawn Izzo . Another camera shows the officer putting Ariana in a chokehold and dragging her across the floor . The young fashion designer said she 'became extremely anxious' and struggled to breathe during the 'attack' 'He then threw Ariana to the ground and maintained Ariana in a choke hold and actually drug Ariana by the neck across the floor outside of 1 Oak for several feet,' claims the lawsuit. The young woman, it says, 'became extremely anxious' as she struggled to breathe. After she broke free from his grip, she punched him. She said she had no idea he was a police officer because he hadn't identified himself to her. 'When he came behind me I didn't know who was attacking me from behind, and all I did was try to defend myself,' she added. 'I feel as if the way he reacted was completely unnecessary, and it shouldn't have happened like that. 'He should have had more control under the situation, instead of escalating it and making it ten times worse.' After breaking free from his grip she punched him (left) - but says she had no idea he was a police officer . Ariana's legs are seen around the officer's hips in the right of this video still as her face is pressed against the glass-topped table - upon which rests a giant vase of pink and yellow flowers . In the CCTV footage obtained by Ariana's lawyer, Officer Izzo and others are seen handcuffing her hands behind her back and leading her to a round, marble table with a glass top. She is made to bend over it, and her face is pushed against it several times by a man standing between her outstretched legs. At one point her legs end up around his waist while her head is pressed on the table. Her face was rammed so hard on to the glass that it shattered - and shards embedded in her chin. Two of her teeth were broken, too. A photo of her injuries was shown to reporters by Mr Bryson yesterday. He said his client had needed several operations to repair her face. He added: 'Once Ariana was handcuffed with her hands behind her back, she was not a threat.' Ariana cried throughout yesterday's appearance. She claims the color of her skin was a factor in the incident . Ariana had been charged with battery on a protected person but prosecutors dismissed the case last month. She filed an internal affairs complaint but police ratified Izzo's conduct. Records show that Ariana was one of two people arrested on felony battery on a police officer charges in the incident. Six others were arrested on misdemeanor charges. She admitted she was 20 at the time but said she had 'only two drinks' during the night out. She added that she hadn't been asked for ID when she arrived at the nightclub with her boyfriend. The club's operator has yet to comment. Ariana's lawsuit against Izzo and his police department alleges civil rights violations and excessive force and claims he lacked proper training and supervision. Officer Izzo didn't respond to requests yesterday for a comment. Police spokesman Michael Rodriguez said the department didn't comment on litigation.","Shawn Izzo is alleged to have used 'excessive force' on Ariana Mason .

7912,"The continents of North and South America came together much earlier than previously thought, according to researchers who found evidence in rock deposits from ancient rivers in Colombia of the land bridge that connected the long-isolated landmasses. The two continents are linked at Panama, but there has been a debate about when this land bridge first appeared, with most experts placing its formation at about 3 million years ago. The new study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, presents evidence that the Panama land bridge formed at least 10 million years earlier. Before the Isthmus of Panama rose from the sea by tectonic and volcanic action, the Central American Seaway linked the Atlantic to the Pacific as one great ocean. The various continents, sitting atop huge plates akin to jigsaw puzzle pieces sliding over Earth's mantle, have slowly moved around the globe during the planet's history. They have separated, drifted and joined numerous times in a process called plate tectonics. South America became an isolated landmass when it separated from Africa. Likewise, North America broke apart from Europe and headed on a gradual collision course with South America. Until then, a deep water channel called the Central American Seaway separated the continents. The researchers base their estimate on the presence of small grains of a mineral called zircon unearthed in ancient river bedrock in northern Colombia that originated in Panama and were 13 million to 15 million years old. These grains suggested the land bridge must have existed at that time, they said. 'We contend that a bridge, perhaps a transient one, was present since 13 to 15 million years ago,' said geologist Camilo Montes of Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, who led the study. 'Beds younger than about 13 to 15 million years contain abundant zircon grains with a typically Panamanian age,' said Montes. 'Older beds do not. 'We think these zircons were deposited by rivers flowing from the Isthmus of Panama when it docked to South America, nearly 10 million years earlier than the date of 3 million years that is usually given for the connection.' The various continents, sitting atop huge plates akin to jigsaw puzzle pieces sliding over Earth's mantle, have slowly moved around the globe during the planet's history. They have separated, drifted and joined numerous times in a process called plate tectonics. South America became an isolated landmass when it separated from Africa. Likewise, North America broke apart from Europe and headed on a gradual collision course with South America. One of the most dramatic results of the joining of the two Americas was the mixing of the animals living on the respective landmasses, with various creatures crossing the land bridge to invade the other continent. The event is known as the Great American Biological Interchange. After the Isthmus of Panama formed, animals and plants could move back and forth between continents, the Great American Biological Interchange. Smithsonian scientists are debating when this happened. South America had a unique animal population, with exotic marsupials including saber-toothed predators, as well as elephant-sized ground sloths, car-sized armadillos, camel-like creatures with elephant trunks and giant flightless, carnivorous 'terror birds.' North America had a quite different and impressive array of placental mammals including saber-toothed cats and other feline predators, huge short-faced bears, wolves and various herbivores including big elephant relatives and horses. The two continents continue to move together. 'Yes, the plates are moving today,' Montes said. 'They never stop.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Researchers had previously believed continents connected 3m years ago .

10633,"Charlie Adam looked up, noticed Thibaut Courtois was off his line, and thought: ‘Why not?’ Why not, indeed. The Stoke City midfielder was 66 yards from goal but had the audacity to score what will surely be crowned the Barclays Premier League’s strike of the season. David Beckham did it against Wimbledon in August 1996, as did Wayne Rooney against West Ham last March. There was Xabi Alonso in 2006 and Maynor Figueroa three years later, too. Charlie Adam (centre) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois watches on as he is unable to stop Adam's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1-1 . Yet this was different. It was not a hit and hope. It was not a lob. This was a direct shot from deep inside Adam’s own half which fooled one of the world’s greatest goalkeepers — and Adam meant it. Sportmail’s Jamie Redknapp agreed. ‘This is better than Beckham, more audacious than Rooney’s last season, This is one of the best strikes we’ve ever seen. It’s an absolutely incredible piece of play by Charlie Adam. ‘You categorise goals as great individual efforts or team goals, but that was a piece of genius. To even try it is brilliant.’ Even by the standards those at Stamford Bridge are used to seeing week in, week out, this was special. Particularly because it came from an unexpected source, from a ‘bloke who looks like a bus driver’, as former English cricket captain Freddie Flintoff colourfully put it. Nineteen years ago, when Beckham introduced himself to the world with his goal from the halfway line, he did so wearing the wrong footwear. The Manchester United great beat Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan wearing custom-made boots embroidered with ‘Charlie’ on the tongue — adidas sending Beckham a pair which were actually intended for Rangers attacking midfielder Charlie Miller. Adam (second left) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game . David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996 . Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season . Chelsea became the second team to score 100 penalties in the Premier League. Liverpool were the first and have now scored 102. Miller never got his boots as they were retired, turned into a museum piece, having helped Beckham towards his first of 115 England caps less than three weeks later against Moldova. From one Scottish Charlie to another, Adam plans to frame his boots and shirt from Stamford Bridge, but this goal is unlikely to be the making of the former Rangers, Blackpool and Liverpool midfielder as it was for Beckham. Yet in the four seconds it took for the ball to go from boot to net, Adam disproved the theory that sequels are never better than the original. ‘The manager kept saying to me, “come in the middle of the pitch”, to try to get on the ball,’ Adam said. ‘I’m not a winger, I’m not a wide left midfielder, I don’t have the pace to go in behind so I’ve seen an opening, I’ve seen the goalie off his line and I thought, “why not do it at a place like Chelsea?” 'I’ve seen the goalie back-pedalling and I was praying it would go in. I’ll remember it for the rest of my career.’ From Spain’s Marca to Italy’s La Gazzetta dello Sport, the goal has been admired worldwide. One man who does not want to see it again, however, is Jose Mourinho. It left a black mark against a win which moved them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, yet even the Chelsea manager can admire a wonder-goal when one comes along, as much as it hurts to admit it. Even Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had to admit that Adam's goal was a strike of the highest quality . Adam (right) celebrates with his Stoke City team-mates after scoring at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . ‘It was a fantastic goal, every player in the world would like to score a goal like that,’ Mourinho said. ‘Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi to all these brilliant players. Not all of them did score that goal in their careers.’ Maradona, Messi, and Adam. Unlike the Argentinian greats, he is known more for his heavy tackling, as Gareth Bale found out when he suffered ankle ligament damage in May 2011. Yet this was straight from the Pele playbook. Stoke had not managed a single shot on target with half-time minutes away and there seemed no danger as Adam picked up the ball 10 yards inside his own half. Courtois mistakenly thought the same. Yet this is nothing new from Adam. He did it for Blackpool reserves previously, and Ross County, too. Asked if it is something he thinks about using regularly during a game, Adam said: ‘Every time.’ Midway through this interview, Chelsea striker Didier Drogba interrupts. ‘Why?’ he asks Adam in mock indignation. ‘Tell me why?’ To which Adam replies: ‘I watch your videos.’ Indeed there are compilations of goals just as outrageous on YouTube and, on Saturday, Adam rightly earned his place in history among them.","Charlie Adam scored remarkable goal in defeat to league leaders .

10650,"A motorist known as Mr X who spent five years trying to dodge a £60 speeding fine has been jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice. The driver, who is named Ashley X after changing his surname by deed poll, was caught on camera driving his Honda sports car at 67mph on a 50mph section of the M11 in Essex in 2009. Instead of coughing up a fixed penalty fine, he initially ignored Essex Police's attempts to confirm who was driving the car before making up a series of stories to shift the blame, Essex Police said. The driver was caught on camera driving his Honda sports car at 67mph on a 50mph section of the M11 . Pc Roy Keyes, from the force's casualty reduction team,  said: 'Ashley X was determined to avoid paying the £60 fine and having three penalty points on his licence. 'But for five years he tried to deny the offence and committed two serious offences which ultimately led to him being sent to prison.' X tried to fight the speeding charge in six different courts, concocting various stories including that his cousin was driving, faking a letter from that cousin purportedly confirming this and claiming this cousin had already paid the fine. After being found guilty of failing to provide a driver's details he challenged the verdict at Chelmsford Crown Court and the Court of Appeal but both claims were rejected. When police looked more closely at the case,  they found the 'cousin' who X claimed had been driving, and discovered he was in fact a friend, who never owned the car and denied writing any letter admitting that he had been the driver. The driver tried to convince authorities that his cousin was driving the car at the time of the offence . X, from Ruislip, west London, finally admitted perjury and perverting the course of justice at Ipswich Crown Court on Thursday. Judge Martyn Levett sentenced X to nine months imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay costs of £1,200. Essex Police praised the Crown Prosecution Service for its perseverance in bringing the case against the 35-year-old motorist. Do you know Mr X?

So please read on to learn more about this and other ""beauty"" trends inspired by the Kardashians: . Used to be, YouTube would teach the kiddos how to put on eyeliner or style their hair like a favorite star. That's so old-school. Now, the nets say you should stick your lips in a shot glass, suck all the air out and then pull it off to reveal your all-new plump kisser, just like Kylie Jenner. Except, well, see for yourself. The hashtag #KylieJennerChallenge has been trending on Twitter in recent days, with posters showing off the often disturbing results of their efforts. ""Made my chin look like a hickey a week ago and I'll say iv never felt so dumb,"" Twitter user emmaburkie posted Monday. Plenty of folks shared the sentiment. Many were people who'd tried it. Others were just shaking their heads. Surgeon Dr. Dendy Engelman told Seventeen that the trend is dangerous. ""Not only can significant pain, swelling, and bruising result from these suction techniques, but there is potential risk for scarring and permanent disfigurement with repeated attempts,"" Engelman said. Jenner has tweeted her disapproval of the lip-plumping trend she inspired. It's a trend that predates the Kardashians, but they certainly gave us a lot of it: the sideboob, the flash of breast from the side of a dress, shirt or just about anything else that can be draped on a woman's body. According to Google, the arbiter of all things, search interest in sideboob has fallen off since its 2012 peak, when Huffington Post dutifully reported ""another day, another sideboob"" shot from Kim Kardashian. How about something newer? Surely you've heard of the ""belfie""? A term reportedly coined by Kim Kardashian herself, this charming practice -- a butt selfie -- involves posting self-photography of one's posterior, thusly: . The trend took off last year, with a deluge of broadcast butts and not a little derision, but may have reached its peak with the apparently real belfie stick -- a device for taking ""perfect belfies simply and quickly."" Butt never fear, Kylie Jenner is here to keep the trend going, with a belfie taken just this month liked by 1.4 million people: . Here's a fact for you: In 2014, the number of women undergoing ""buttock augmentation"" rose by a mountainous 86%, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Reports. Why? Kim Kardashian, of course, say the doctors. ""While a rounder, more curvaceous derriere has been in vogue for a number of years, celebrities like (Nicki) Minaj and Kim Kardashian have brought the attention to the rear to an all-time high influencing more women to undergo buttock augmentation to achieve the hourglass look,"" Dr. Constantino Mendieta said in an ASAPS statement. And he should know. He bills himself a ""butt augmentation specialist."" Back in the day, folks who wanted to look like Rachel from ""Friends"" got her haircut. Now, they get surgery. Well, some of them. Meet Jordan James Parke, who made news this year with an interview with Britain's The Sun newspaper in which he reportedly said he spent $150,000 to look like, you guessed it, Kim Kardashian. He later told US Magazine he doesn't want to look exactly like Kim. But he'd die for her butt. ""I'd like to get a bum as big as hers, but I won't get implants,"" the magazine quoted him as saying. ""I've been looking at body contour -- I want to get lipo on my stomach and back and then they put the fat back into your bum.""","From belfies to butt implants, the Kardashian clan has inspired many a trend .

8443,"Questions have again been raised about Tony Blair's money-making since leaving Downing Street in 2007 . Tony Blair's global money-making projects face fresh scrutiny today after publication of a bizarre deal to sell the theory of 'deliverology' to Colombia. Questions have also been raised about why the fees for the former Labour Prime Minister – who last week denied being in the 'league of the super-rich - are being paid by the United Arab Emirates, and not the Colombian government. The contract sets out in great detail Mr Blair's demands for confidentiality, and includes a requirement that his wife Cherie join him on trips to South America. Mr Blair last week defended earning money since leaving Downing Street, claiming it pays for the 'infrastructure' around him. But critics have questioned the role of a former Prime Minister working for other sovereign states, and claimed there could be a conflict of interest between his role as the Middle East envoy and earning money from governments in the region. Today the Sunday Telegraph revealed details of a contract signed between Mr Blair and the Colombian government in 2013. Fees paid to Tony Blair Associates for the work advising Colombia on its mining industry, which brings in £2billion-a-year in royalties. The 34page contract for a year was signed between Columbia's department of national planning, and Windrush No 3 LP, an arm of Mr Blair's business network. It included carrying out a 'stocktake' of mining deals and contains at least 10 clauses on confidentiality. It also boasts that Tony Blair Associates outperforms rival consultancy firms because it works with 'founders of deliverology' – jargon for the way governments can get things done. 'All our team members will have expertise in ... deliverology or mining induced growth strategies,' it says. The business proposal states: 'Mr Blair, with his extensive on-the-job experience and politician instincts, will personally lead this project. 'Typically his contribution will go beyond the narrow focus of the specific project, and our growing understanding of the situation on the ground will allow Mr Blair to serve as an adviser to the government in several other areas, be it in domestic matters or questions of international politics.' Tory MP Andrew Bridgen today called for curbs on former Prime Minister's working for other governments. He told MailOnline: 'Anyone who has been Prime Minister and privy to the secrets of this nation should hold should never work for another sovereign government.' Mr Bridgen says ex-PMs should be bound for life by the seven principles of public life, known as the Nolan principles, which include accountability and openness.' He added: 'People have got the right to earn money but it is how it is done. At the end of the day I think a lot of the disillusion with politics began in the Blair years. The fall of politicians' standing seriously began in the Blair years when people felt they had been deceived.' Mr Blair defended his money making, telling Newsweek last week said: 'I could not do what I do unless I was also able to generate income'. He added: 'Am I better off than most people? Yeah, I'm very lucky. Am I in the league of the super-rich? Absolutely not, though you will have to make up your own mind about that.' The Colombia contract includes a clause stating that Mr Blair would make two trips a year to Colombia, and he gets to choose who joins him. It specifically includes a statement that this could be his wife Cherie. The Colombia contract also includes a clause stating that Mr Blair would make two trips a year to Colombia, and he gets to choose who joins him. It specifically includes a statement that this could be his wife Cherie. The Columbian government announced at the time that that 'the United Arab Emirates through the Office of Tony Blair [Windrush Ventures No 3 LP] domiciled in the UK' had signed an agreement 'to support the implementation' of the new laws on spending money raised from mining deals. Another deal was signed in 2014, for offering advice on project management, according to the newspaper. Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, told the Telegraph: 'This raises serious questions of a conflict of interest over Mr Blair's roles as businessman and Middle East envoy. 'The UAE is supposed to be a leading donor government on the issue of Gaza and the West Bank, so what does Tony Blair put first, his role as Quartet envoy or his role as a businessman when dealing with them? What is the nature of all these contracts? There is still a lack of transparency about it.' Mr Blair is working with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, for whom he once a foreword for a political book on The Third Way . But Mr Blair's office rejected the claims, and insisted the details of the work had been released in a press statement in 2013. 'There is absolutely nothing improper in this project being funded by UAE… on the contrary the sole objective is to support the Colombian Government's reform programme which aims to modernise public services and increase prosperity for its people. 'The TBA team works exclusively in the interest of and for the benefit of the Government of Colombia. As with any project, we maintain the strict confidentiality requirements of our contract. 'TBA has also been helping establishing a Delivery Unit, so that the government can better deliver services which will increase jobs, reduce poverty and transform the lives of people in Colombia. The work being undertaken is solely for the benefit of Colombia and is at no cost to the government and provided close to cost. 'We have no knowledge let alone involvement in the mining deal you refer to and any suggestion that we have been involved is false, neither were TBA involved in any laws relating to mining fees or royalties. 'And as we have repeatedly made clear, there are no conflicts of interests with any of Mr Blair's work, including his role with the OQR.'","Former Prime Minister struck deal in 2013 to advise on mining industry .

Whatever the emotions running through their young minds, these children are very much the lucky ones. They are among the latest group of migrants to have safely reached land after a desperate voyage across the Mediterranean that has claimed the lives of so many others. Of the 446 people on board the Italian rescue vessel, the navy said 59 of them were children, who were no doubt unaware just how perilous their boat trip could have been. Scroll down for video . Reaching the safety of dry land: Two migrant boys cling to each other as their rescue ship docks in the Sicilian port of Augusta after their smuggler boat was picked up off the coast of the Italian mainland . Apprehension and joy: Two children wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel  as they arrive in Sicily . Relief: A girl waves after being rescued from the Mediterranean with 445 migrants on their way to Europe . They were dropped off in the Sicilian port of Augusta today after their smuggler boat was picked up off the southern coast of the Italian mainland. Their parents had gambled everything to seek a new life in Europe and on this occasion they were lucky it didn't end in tragedy. The same couldn't be said for the 900 men, women and children feared dead after their boat capsized on Sunday in one of the biggest maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. It also follows deeply distressing images showing the body of a young migrant being brought ashore after he drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Rhodes on Monday. Greek police yesterday arrested two suspected people smugglers over the disaster which happened when a wooden boat ran aground on rocks, killing three people. The two Syrian men, aged 26 and 27, were among the 90 survivors of the tragedy, some of whom were filmed being pulled to safety after clinging to wreckage in rough waters.

A woman (left) gives milk to her son as she arrives with others migrans at the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . In the wake of the tragedies, Italy has pressed the European Union to devise plans to stop the tide of migrants on smuggler boats in the Mediterranean. Italian defence minister Roberta Pinotti said refugee camps should be set up in countries bordering Libya and human traffickers must be targeted with military intervention. 'We know where the smugglers keep their boats, where they gather,' Ms Pinotti said. 'The plans for military intervention are there.' She was speaking a day before EU leaders hold an emergency summit in Brussels on the crisis. Ms Pinotti said she was cautiously hopeful that the EU summit would take tangible steps to deal with the migrant crisis. Hundreds of migrants have been arriving on Italian shores for days after being rescued at sea when their overloaded boats run into problems. 'We think it's the moment in which Europe decides, forcefully, to have an international police operation, which will undo this band of criminals,' Ms Pinotti said. Rescued migrants walk along the quayside after disembarking from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica in Sicily . Italy has pressed the EU to devise plans to stop the tide of migrants on smuggler boats in the Mediterranean . Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has urged the European Union to craft long-range, comprehensive policy on the migrants. He said one way would be to establish refugee camps in Niger, Sudan and elsewhere in Africa with UN assistance. Italy has saved some 200,000 migrant lives at sea since the start of 2014. But Italy's 'noble, generous reaction alone isn't enough', he said. 'We are asking Europe to be Europe, not just when it's time to devise a budget.' He said broad, long-term EU strategy, with wider sea patrols and a robust presence in southern Libya, would help combat '21st-century slave drivers' of migrants. Ms Pinotti said Italy would be ready to take the helm of any military intervention if asked and as long as it is carried out as an international mission, backed by the United Nations. 'We're ready to do our share. We're the closest country to Libya,' she said. Exodus: Of the 446 people on board the Italian rescue vessel, the navy said 59 of them were children .

Distressing: A man brings the body of a young migrant ashore after he drowned in a shipwreck off Rhodes . The defence minister said the flow of migrants is not about to stop, saying: '90 per cent are from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia, from places where they are afraid of dying. 'We cannot stop them' from leaving their homelands. Mr Renzi and Ms Pinotti indicated that requests for asylum could be processed in refugee camps in African countries near Libya. These could include Tunisia, Niger and Sudan. Italy's defence minister said that it would then be up to all EU countries to take their share of migrants found eligible for refugee status or asylum. Because Italy is the first EU country the migrants set foot in, they stay in reception centres, sometimes for years, while their requests or appeals for asylum are processed. Migrants deemed ineligible for asylum are ordered to be expelled, but many slip away and head to northern Europe to reach relatives.

7508,"Rory McIlroy admits Thursday cannot come soon enough as he bids to complete the career grand slam by winning the Masters. The hype surrounding McIlroy's attempt to join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods in winning all four major titles has been building since the night before his Open victory at Hoylake last July. And although the return of Woods to competitive action after two months on the sidelines has taken some of the spotlight off McIlroy, the world No 1 is anxious to let his clubs do the talking. Rory McIlroy insists he has arrived at Augusta ready to mount a serious challenge on the Masters . The world No 1 shields himself from the rain as he plays a shot during a practice round . 'I said in the middle of last week, 'If Augusta was to start tomorrow, I'd be okay. I'm ready,'' McIlroy said on Tuesday. 'I think that's a good indication of where I am with my game. I've been ready for this thing to start for a week already so just trying to keep my game where it is and do some quality work, not overdo it. 'Just do the right amount so that when I got here yesterday for the first time, I was ready to play and just needed to go see the golf course. I wasn't working on anything in my game, my swing. Wasn't thinking about technique at all. Just all about hitting the shots I need to and thinking about how to manage my game and get it around here for the next four days. 'Results-wise, the last three tournaments haven't been what I've wanted. I still feel like there's plenty of positives to take from them, especially Doral and Bay Hill, I felt like I played pretty good there. A couple silly mistakes here and there, but for the most part I felt like I got what I needed out of them. 'But the last two weeks have been great. I've just practised at home in Florida and made another trip up here a couple of Fridays ago. 'I just really felt like spending a couple of weeks away from this (media attention), I guess, and just preparing at home and in private and not really having everything critiqued and analysed and over-analysed. I just wanted to get away from it all, and I feel like it's been a good thing.' All eyes have been on Tiger Woods' latest comeback, which could take the pressure off of McIlroy . The Northern Irishman speaks to Wood's girlfriend Lindsey Vonn and his children during practice . McIlroy followed Woods into the media centre at Augusta National and admitted the presence of the 14-time major winner - who was relaxed and jovial with the press - could work in his favour. 'A little bit, I guess,' the 25-year-old added. 'It is such a big story, Tiger coming back at the Masters after a bit of a lengthy period where he has not been around. But still I'm just here to play golf and you guys can write the stories, I won't read them and we'll move on.' McIlroy has recorded just one top-10 finish in six previous appearances at Augusta - last year's tie for eighth - although he did take a four-shot lead into the final round in 2011 before collapsing to a closing 80. He admits he will have to play the par fives better to have a chance of slipping on a green jacket on Sunday, covering them in level par last year compared to eight under by champion Bubba Watson, who finished eight shots ahead. McIlroy led the field heading into the final day of the 2011 Masters before suffering a dramatic meltdown . McIlroy plays a shot from the azaleas as he recorded his best finish of eighth in last year's tournament . But he also believes Augusta National suits his game if he can take advantage of having a nine iron in his hands for second shots to holes like the 13th and 15th. 'I think I've developed a game where I can compete at pretty much any golf course now. That might not have been the case two or three years ago,' McIlroy added. 'But if you're looking at the courses, Augusta's the one that should set up the best for me just with my ball flight and being comfortable off the tee here, especially being able to turn the ball over from right to left. 'If I can play the way I know I can around here and just have a good week on the greens, then there's no reason why I shouldn't have a good chance.'","World No 1 arrives at Masters hoping to complete a career grand slam .

4220,"Rome (CNN)A destination for the destitute, Sicily is the ""promised land"" for thousands of migrants and refugees making the desperate journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast. More than 10,000 people have arrived from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian Coast Guard. Stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between North Africa and Italy; boat people have been arriving on Italy's islands for more than a decade. But what makes the current influx different is the increase in numbers and the absence of control from the ports of embarkation, specifically those in Libya, because when Moammar Gadhafi was in control, he also controlled the flow of migrant ships. In 2008, the-then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi  signed an historic friendship agreement in which Italy promised to invest $5 billion in Libyan infrastructure and Gadhafi promised to close what he described as a ""spigot"" of migrants. During a three-day state visit to Italy in August 2010, he famously threatened to ""turn Europe black"" if Libya did not enjoy cordial relations with the European Union. After the agreement, Gadhafi  kept his promise and the number of arrivals drastically decreased. For a time, almost all migrant arrivals came from Tunisia, just 70 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa. Because Italy sent most of those migrants who did not qualify for political asylum back to Tunisia, the flow eventually tapered off. And once a new Tunisian government was in place, after the Arab Spring, Italy signed an accord with Tunisia in which they promised to help patrol Tunisia's ports. But after Gadhafi was overthrown, the flow of migrants from Libya exploded again: the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Rome told CNN that more than 140,000 migrants arrived from the North Africa coast in 2011. In October 2013, after a tragic boat accident off the coast of Lampedusa in which 349 people -- including an infant still attached to its mother by the umbilical cord -- died, trapped like sardines in their smugglers' boat as it sank, Italy decided it had to act. In November of 2013, the Italian Navy launched a €9M-a-month search-and-rescue program called Mare Nostrum, in which Italian naval ships patrolled the seas to rescue migrants. In just one year, the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants, according to the Italian Navy. Due to budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean, the mission ended in October 2014. By the end of the year, more than 174,000 people had been rescued in Italy; an estimated 3,072 people died making the journey, according to the IOM. In November last year, the European Union's border control, Frontex, started its own mission -- Triton -- with a budget of less than a third that of Mare Nostrum. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend them ships; a ship from Iceland, at the far north of the continent, is currently involved in Frontex's operations off southern Europe. When Italy ended Mare Nostrum, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres warned that some European governments were making ""keeping foreigners out a higher priority than upholding asylum standards."" ""This is a mistake, and precisely the wrong reaction for an era in which record numbers of people are fleeing wars,"" Guterres told a UNHCR policy meeting. ""Security and immigration management are concerns for any country, but policies must be designed in a way that human lives do not end up becoming collateral damage."" Once migrants arrive in Italy, they are supposed to be processed for political asylum and monitored until it is granted or denied, but Italy has been sanctioned by the European Union for not fingerprinting new arrivals. By law, Italy has to take care of the arrivals, but many have no intention of staying in the country, and few of the reception centers are gated, meaning migrants can come and go as they please. And with no physical border controls between Italy and other European countries, they can then disperse across the continent. Moutassem Yazbek, 27, an IT specialist who worked for six years in Dubai, arrived in Sicily in December on board a smuggler's boat. He told CNN he was never fingerprinted in Italy, and eventually made it to Germany where he is studying to learn the language and find work. He says the human trafficking network is a finely-oiled machine that fills a growing need. ""I would have done anything to get here,"" Yazbek said. ""It was worth the risk, the bad treatment and the fear. Hard as that may be to believe, it is a better life.""","Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees risk the perilous journey across the Mediterranean every year .

4142,"A British couple who are believed to have fled their Berkshire home with their four young children in a bid to escape to Syria have reportedly been arrested in Turkey. Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four children were caught on CCTV boarding a cross-Channel ferry from Dover earlier this month. Thames Valley Police believed they arrived in Calais, France, before travelling south down through Europe in a bid to flee to Syria. However, a Turkish official claimed today that the couple had been arrested in Ankara and are currently in custody with their four children - daughter Zoha, seven, and three sons Essa, four, Zakariva, two, and Yahya, one. Photos released by the Turkish government show Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) pushing prams for their young children. They have been arrested by police in Ankara as they tried to go to Syria . Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four young children have reportedly been arrested in Ankara, Turkey. The family of six have been missing from their home in Slough, Berkshire, since April 7 . The family, who were spotted on CCTV at Dover catching a ferry to France on April 8 (pictured), were not reported missing by their relatives until eight days later. Police fear they may have been trying to get to Syria . Malik, 31, who has fled the UK with his family, was pictured at a protest outside the Lebanese embassy in London in May last year holding a pro-ISIS poster. The large poster stated 'Stop Terrorism Against Sunnis' Earlier, British authorities had said that there was no suggestion the family was doing any fighting in Syria, and it was unclear whether they were sympathetic to members of the Islamic State group or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But earlier today, the Mail revealed how Malik was pictured waving a flag in support of ISIS at a demonstration in London last year. The photograph shows Malik - a member of the banned UK extremist group al-Mujahiroun - holding a pro-ISIS sign at a protest against the arrest of hate preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad in May last year. The picture, taken by extremism researcher Jacob Michelson, shows the 31-year-old standing outside the Lebanese embassy in London brandishing a poster which reads 'Islamic State Is Solution', with the first letter of each word highlighted to spell out 'ISIS'. Bakri, who led a number of hate groups in Britain before being kicked out of the UK, was arrested in Lebanon in May, and is believed still to be in detention there. Earlier today Ms Kiran's family made an emotional appeal directly to her, urging her to get in touch so that they know the family is safe. 'We would like to urge you, Sara and Asif, to make contact with us and let us know that you and the children are safe,' relatives said in a statement. 'Sara, we want to let you know that we love you - we miss you, Asif and the grandchildren. You are not in trouble, we are not angry or upset, and we just want you to return home safely.' Thames Valley Police said yesterday that the Malik family were last seen on Tuesday April 7 but were only reported missing to police last Thursday, April 16. Malik (left) and Dhar (right) are pictured at a protest outside outside Regent's Park Mosque in May last year . Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) disappeared from their home in Berkshire this month . Malik and Ms Kiran, who neighbours said usually wore the full Islamic veil, left home without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to family members, which a force spokesman said was 'entirely out of character for this family'. Police said the family boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais at 12.30am on Wednesday, April 8. Neighbours said the alarm was raised after at least one of their four children failed to attend school. Their grandmother was also seen looking for them and knocking on other doors in the modern block of flats where they lived, asking if anyone had seen the family. Neither Malik nor his partner have attempted to contact any family members or friends since, despite taking their mobile phones with them on the trip, police said. Police said the lack of contact led detectives to believe their reason for leaving Britain may not be legitimate. Deputy Chief Constable John Campbell said yesterday: 'Given the online rhetoric from the Islamic State encouraging people to travel to Syria, the direction of travel and concerns voiced by Asif's family, we are concerned the family may be seeking to travel to Syria.' Anjem Choudary confirmed yesterday that Malik had been a member of al-Mujahiroun, and described him as a 'champion for shariah' who regularly attended the group's events and demonstrations. The Malik family's last known address in Slough, Berkshire, was in the block of flats on the left of this image . Siddhartha Dhar posted this picture of himself with a gun and his newborn baby on Twitter shortly after arriving in Syria last year. Dhar fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year . Both Malik and Dhar are believed to be followers of notorious preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured above) Dhar - one of Choudary's top henchmen - fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year while under investigation by Scotland Yard. He was one of nine men who were detained on September 25 last year on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and supporting al-Muhajiroun. Just hours after publicly declaring he had arrived in Syria, Dhar announced he had become a father to a baby boy who was a member of the latest generation of Islamist extremists. He wrote: 'Alhamdulillah, Allah blessed me with a healthy baby boy in the Islamic State. He is another great addition to the Islamic State. And he's definitely not British.' In a picture posted on Twitter at the time, Dhar was seen posing with an AK47 in one hand and his new-born baby in the other while standing in front of a mustard-coloured pickup truck, wearing a thick military style coat and boots. Two other followers of Choudary who have left Britain to join a terror group are Abu Rahin Aziz, from Luton, and former NHS surgeon Mirza Tariq Ali. Aziz skipped bail before he was handed a 36-week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in London's West End, while Ali was arrested for repeatedly assaulting a bystander at a rally and was reported to have been killed while fighting with the Taliban last month.

1216,"Two French backpackers who filmed themselves torching a native Australian quokka have been released from prison. Thibaud Jean Leon Vallet, 24, and his cousin Jean Mickael Batrikian, 18, pleaded guilty to animal cruelty after footage emerged of the pair lighting the quokka on fire with an aerosol can and a lighter on Rottnest Island on April 3. The pair appeared before Fremantle Magistrate's Court last Friday and were ordered to pay $4000 and were told that they would be held behind bars for seven days if they fail to pay the fines. Scroll down for video . The two French tourists charged with setting fire to a quokka have been released from jail after spending a week behind bars . The French men opted to serve the seven days in Hakea prison rather than pay the fine, as they did not have sufficient funds. A Department of Corrective Services spokeswoman said that the week long sentence was considered the equivalent of the fine, and that it had been served in full, reported WA Today. The men were released at 11.30 am on Thursday morning after entering the jail, in Canning Vale, Western Australia on Friday. According to Corrective Services, the two French men cost taxpayers $1810 each day they were in jail, despite the fact that the pair had saved over $12,000 between them in their working holiday employment as cleaners, reported The Esperance Express. The creature survived the incident by scampering away, but was singed by the flame . Animal rights activists have claimed that the pair's punishment was too lenient for their crime . Using a deodorant can and lighter, the men torch the defenseless creature which quickly scampers away . Animal rights activists have claimed that the pair's punishment was too lenient for their crime. 'It was pretty disgusting,' said Peter Murphy from Quokka Rescue. 'I don't think the sentence is enough. I think they got off quite lightly.' The video of the crime was played in court on Friday, and Magistrate Elizabeth Langdon labelled the act 'outrageous', reported The West Australian. In the disturbing footage of their crime, both men are heard laughing uncontrollably after igniting the quokka before one said 'Don't do that, why?' The creature survived the incident by scampering away, but was singed by the flame. The magistrate was told that Vallet and Batrikian were remorseful for their actions, and that they admitted the incident was stupid and juvenile. The men can be heard uncontrollably laughing after igniting the native Australian creature . The quokka is a small wallaby and resembles a diminutive version of the kangaroo with thick brown fur . Magistrate Langdon commented on their cruelty, calling the offence 'abhorrent.' 'One can only imagine the impact caused to the quokka,' she said. 'Obviously it would have been fearful as a result of what occurred.' The men told Fairfax Media outside court on Saturday, 'you think we're monsters? We didn't hurt the quokka. We have pets at home.' Both men were on a working holiday and were spending three months in Rottnest Island working as cleaners. As a result of the incident, both men lost their job. They also had their passports confiscated and are expected to be leaving Australia soon.

11311,"The Tories have accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a businessman whose company duped thousands of families in a mis-selling scandal. Multi-millionaire Richard Harpin has given the Tories £375,000 since 2008 – including £50,000 in the first week of the election campaign, official records show. The revelation will raise fresh questions for David Cameron over his links to millionaire donors. Multi-millionaire Richard Harpin has given the Tories £375,000 since 2008 – including £50,000 in the first week of the election campaign . Mr Harpin is the chief executive of HomeServe – the maintenance firm which styles itself as the UK's 'fifth emergency service'. But the firm was handed a record £30million fine last year for selling families expensive home insurance cover using misleading information and hard sell tactics. The fine came on top of some £40million it is paying in refunds to thousands of wronged customers who took out the policies. Industry regulator the Financial Conduct Authority found customers were misled or bullied into taking out policies they did not need or did not cover all the problems claimed. The company – which claims it offers peace of mind to consumers who are worried about losing their boiler or water supply in the dead of winter – has three million customers in the UK, holding 7.5million policies. Tory donor Mr Harpin founded the company in 1993. The firm today employs over 2,500 people in the UK and nearly 4,000 globally and is the biggest employer in Walsall. HomeServe said the investigation was closed over a year ago, in February 2014, and related to mis-selling in the period prior to October 2011. A spokesperson said: 'Richard Harpin has been a supporter of the Conservative party for a number of years and his political donations are made in a personal capacity.' But Labour said the donation showed the Tories were out to support their wealthy friends. Jon Ashworth, Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: 'We all know that the Tories put the interests of their big money donors before those of hardworking families.' The Tories under David Cameron have  accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a businessman whose company duped thousands of families in a mis-selling scandal . A Tory spokesman said: 'All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with Electoral Commission rules. 'Any suggestion of impropriety by the party is malicious and defamatory and will be treated as such.' The revelation comes just two days after the Tories were forced to return a donation of £50,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges. Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of £20,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers. But it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge. However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands. The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans. Donations from the Tollmans were fully declared and in strict accordance with electoral law.' Since 2011, Mrs Tollman has donated more than £50,000 to the Conservatives.","EXCLUSIVE: Richard Harpin has given the Tories £375,000 since 2008 .

7225,"Wayne Rooney and his England team-mates were upset by the sloppy, uninspired way they started in Italy on Tuesday night. Nine months on from meeting at the World Cup, the Three Lions faced the Azzurri once more in a glamour friendly at the Juventus Stadium. Hopes were high after seven straight wins but Roy Hodgson's men struggled in the first half, deservedly falling behind to a Graziano Pelle header in Turin. England captain Wayne Rooney issues instructions during the 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday night . Rooney said he and the rest of the England players were upset by their first half performance . However, half-time brought with it renewed enthusiasm and England dominated the second period, levelling in style through Andros Townsend and going close to turning a 1-1 into an away triumph. 'We have (moved on from the World Cup) and I think that's why we were so disappointed with the first half,' England skipper Rooney said. 'We know we're better than that. Even though we had a lot of changes, we know we are a better team than what we showed first half. 'We were upset, I'll be honest, in the dressing room after the first half. Everyone was upset with the way we performed. Rooney and the rest of the England squad arrived back from Italy on Wednesday after their flight was delayed . The squad were supposed to fly home on Tuesday night after the match but a technical fault caused delay . 'It showed great character from everyone to go out in the second half to put in the performance we did, to get back in the game and were unlucky not to go on and win it. 'Italy are a great team and I think one of their biggest strengths is seeing the game out. 'We worked hard, we pushed the ball well, showed a lot of composure on the ball and created chances. 'On another night we might have scored another goal, but I think overall probably a draw for both teams was a fair result in the way the game went.' Graziano Pelle opened the scoring as England deservedly went behind in the first half against Italy . Andros Townsend equalised for Roy Hodgson's side during a much-improved second period . Things certainly ended positively for England, with Rooney dovetailing well with full debutant Harry Kane as Hodgson's second-half introductions stated their case. Ross Barkley was one of the stand-out performers, with the second-half substitute showing flashes of the form which impressed so many last summer. 'Ross is a terrific player,' Rooney said. 'He is a terrific young player and I think he can have an impact when he comes on. 'He did that, he took the ball, he ran at the Italian defenders and made it difficult for them. 'Hopefully, he can kick on now for the rest of the season.'","England drew 1-1 against Italy in friendly at Juventus Stadium on Tuesday .

8022,"A chameleon balances carefully on a branch, waiting calmly for its prey... except that if you look closely, you will see that this picture is not all that it seems. For the 'creature' poised to pounce is not a colourful species of lizard but something altogether more human. Featuring two carefully painted female models, it is a clever piece of sculpture designed to create an amazing illusion. It is the work of Italian artist Johannes Stoetter. Scroll down for video . Can you see us? Italian artist Johannes Stoetter has painted two naked women to look like a chameleon . The 37-year-old has previously transformed his models into frogs and parrots but this may be his most intricate and impressive piece to date. Stoetter daubed water-based body paint on the naked models to create the multicoloured effect, then intertwined them to form the shape of a chameleon. To complete the deception, the models rested on a bench painted to match their skin and held the green branch in the air beneath them. Stoetter can take weeks to plan one of his pieces and hours to paint it. Speaking about The Chameleon, he said: 'I worked about four days to design the motif bigger and paint it with colours. 'The body painting took me about six hours with the help of an assistant. 'I covered the hair with natural clay to make the heads look bald. Camouflage job: A few finishing touches are applied to the two naked models to complete the transformation . 'There are different difficulties on different levels as in every work, but I think that my passion and love to my work is so big, that I figure out a way to deal with difficulties. 'My main inspirations are nature, my personal life-philosophy, every-day-life and people themselves. However, the finished result existed only briefly before the models were able to get up and wash the paint off – with just a video and some photographs to record it. The artist added:   'I think that body painting is a good way to learn to let something go, to separate from something. That happens again and again in life and it is good to be able to handle with it. 'Also the fast end of the artwork makes us perceive it in a much more intensive way.' But there is one way in which the chameleon can still claim to be the unchallenged master of disguise. Unlike the real thing, Stoetter's models can't change their colour – unless he gets his paintbrush out.","Johannes Stoetter's artwork features two carefully painted female models .

5389,"Alan Greaves, pictured, claimed 'the Illuminati framed him by downloading child abuse images on his computer . A father-of-eight caught with almost 20,000 images of child abuse on his computer and mobile claimed he was framed by the Illuminati. Police raided Alan Greaves's home in Colne, Lancashire in September 2013 where they found the disturbing images on a digital storage device. Forensic examination of the abuse images found almost 700 were of the most serious category, with a further 872 at the next level. Burnley Crown Court heard there were also 17,821 other indecent images with 106 movies. Laura Barbour, defending, said she had been instructed the reason Greaves had the images on his computer was because he was conducting an investigation on the 'Illuminati'. He believed the group 'disseminates' such material and that is how images ended up on his computer, the court heard. She added: 'He told police he has no interest in children sexually in any way.' The court was told the defendant, who has children aged around 30 to two-years-old, was also a full-time carer for his disabled sister. Jailing him for 21 months, Judge Simon Newell said there appeared to be sexually-explicit images of females aged just 10, or younger, which had assembled over a three-year period. 'If it was not for people viewing these images, there would be a chance these children would not be harmed,' he said. Greaves, who pleaded guilty to two offences of making indecent images, was also given a sexual harm prevention order and told to sign the sex offenders' register for the next 10 years. He is also barred from working with children. Burnley Crown Court, pictured, heard that almost 700 of the images were in the most serious category . The Illuminati featured in the movie Angels & Demons based on the best-selling novel by Dan Brown . Some conspiracy theorists claim the pyramid and eye on a US $1 note is evidence of the Illuminati . The Illuminati are a secret society who was founded in the late 1700s in Munich, Bavaria, named after the Latin word for 'Enlightenment'. The secret society has been blamed for a range of events by crazed conspiracy theorists. Some theorists have linked the organisation with the Battle of Waterloo; the French Revolution; the assassination of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. Others believe that the Illuminati control Hollywood and have a membership which includes senior political leaders. According to one conspiracy theory site, there are only 6,000 members worldwide with a ruling council consisting of five Americans, five western Europeans, one Russian and one Indian. The Illuminati claim they want to overthrow current governments and introduce their own New World Order. The organisation have been accused of being devil worshipers and conspiracy theorists claim that the Illuminati manifest their power by showing their symbols such as triangles, pyramids and the number 666. Conspiracy theorists believe the Illuminati want to rule the world with a single government which they control and introduce a single currency. The more far-fetched theorists claim the Illuminati control groups such as the Bildeberg group as well as the United Nations. They are also accused of having control of the Free Masons and other secret organisations.","Alan Greaves owned almost 700 of the worst type of child abuse images .

7817,"Edmund Echukwu collapsed in a swimming pool and died at a 007-themed sex party last Friday . The man who died in a swimming pool at a swingers' party in an upmarket village has been named as a father-of-three. Edmund Echukwu, 35, was pulled from the water at a James Bond-themed sex party at a £3million mansion in Radlett, Hertfordshire last Friday night. Fellow revellers tried to revive him but he was pronounced dead at Watford General Hospital after emergency services were called. It is believed Mr Echukwu is a Nigerian from north London who was at his first swingers' party at the eight-bedroom house. Mr Echukwu's neighbour in Edgware, Margaret Brown, paid tribute to him today. Mrs Brown, 67, said: 'I'm devastated. He was such a sweet guy. I remember I used to talk to him a lot of the time. 'He kept himself to himself, but he used to talk to me and was very friendly. I think he was going through a difficult time. 'He was just such a gentle person. - I can't believe this has happened. Sometimes he would help me look after my disabled husband.' Mrs Brown said she believed Mr Echukwu was a care worker. She said she knew he had two sons from a previous relationship, but didn't see them very often. She added: 'He was a good-looking guy, and he always looked really slick.' Mr Echukwu had told others at the party he had three children, but there was no suggestion he was married, it was reported this morning. A 35-year-old man, named today as Edmund Echukwu, died during a sex party at this house in Hertfordshire . Witnesses said Mr Echukwu was in the water with a woman when he started getting into difficulties . He wrote about his love of football and described himself as an 'evil genius' on Twitter, according to The Sun newspaper. A post mortem examination is due to be held today, after which a coroner will open an inquest into his death. The party was one of the regular swingers' events put on by retired management consultant Richard Stanley, 66, and his partner Janet Harrison, 58. Mr Stanley said: 'I heard a shout and ran over. I dived in fully clothed, pausing only to take my iPhone out of my pocket. He was enormously heavy. 'Three of the guys pulled him out, with me pushing him from behind. They put him straight into the CPR position and tried to revive him. One of the guests was a qualified nurse.' The death happened at a swingers party run by Richard Stanley and Janet Harrison, pictured in a Channel 4 documentary. Mr Stanley said the death may have been caused by a heart attack . The mansion's owners say the pool complies with all health and safety rules and has been inspected . Mr Stanley added: 'I got straight on to 999. The call operator gave very clear instructions, which I shouted to the team performing CPR. We kept doing that until the ambulance arrived. 'Then the police turned up – there were about a dozen officers in total by the end of the night. After interviewing various people, the inspector said to me, 'this is a non-suspicious death'. It may well be that he had a heart attack.' He said guests brought their own alcohol to the parties and Mr Echukwu had 'severely dented a bottle of Jack Daniel's'. A woman who was in the pool with Mr Echukwu was left distraught by what happened, witnesses said. The event on Friday night featured 007 references including a roulette wheel, a woman covered in gold paint inspired by Goldfinger and chocolate replicas of the weapon from The Man With The Golden Gun. The property features a converted attic which Mr Stanley calls the 'dungeon in the sky'","Edmund Echukwu died in pool at swingers' party in Hertfordshire on Friday .

3971,"An Uber customer was hit with a huge $16,000 bill for her 7-mile nightmare journey across New York. Jaime Hessel said her driver had been on his phone, cut across lanes, and even driven down a bus lane during the 35 minute 'trip from hell' from her East Williamsburg apartment to Midtown East. So she was stunned to receive a message from the cab-hailing app telling her she owed them thousands of dollars for the trip across boroughs, reported the Gothamist. The infuriating story was first posted on Reddit. Scroll down for video . Horrified: Jaimie Hessel says Uber billed her $16,000 for a 35-minute 'car ride from hell' - and says she's never going to trust the cab-hailing service again . The journey began on March 28 when Ms Hessel decided to call an UberX car to get to a fundraising pub crawl for cancer due to start at 1pm. But alarms bells were triggered as soon as she got in the car to find the driver appeared distracted. After sitting in the vehicle for around five minutes before setting off, he soon began to ignore the GPS, taking a longer and more complicated route, according to Ms Hessel. To the passenger's terror, instead of paying his full attention to the road, the driver was also taking phone calls and checking his voicemail during the trip. Ms Hessel claims that the car dangerously cut across lanes of traffic on several occasions and was even driven down a bus lane until she demanded to be let out early. 'I had him drop me off a block away from the bar because I didn't want to be in the car anymore. I felt very unsafe,' she told the Gothamist. Shock: Ms Hessel was horrified when Uber billed her for $16,000 - with a $4,000 refund. Her total statement was $12,251.49 . Uber says the eye-popping figure was a clerical error and that the customer was never actually charged the outrageous sum . But the nightmare trip was far from over. After receiving her initial bill of $56.40, the passenger immediate e-mailed Uber Support to complain she had been overcharged and that the driver had unnecessarily extended the ride. Within a few days, the Uber resp had written back to inform Ms Hessel the company agreed the journey was 'inefficient' and she would get a refund of $15. But the following morning, she received a bizarre email which stated she owed Uber more than $16,000 - with a refund of $4,000. Her total, in the end, came to $12,251.49. 'It freaked me out,' she told DNA Info. 'I have bad eye sight and I thought maybe I wasn't reading it correctly.' The panicked Ms Hessel quickly got in touch with the company again to inform them of their error and said she felt lucky that her credit card had expired between the journey and the bill so the transport app would have been unable to charge her. Uber has since wiped the bill and offered to pay her the original $15 refund but Ms Hessel said she now feels she can't trust them with her new card details. They say it was a clerical error and that she was never actually charged the $16,000. She added it was unlikely she would ever use the app again. 'I don't know if I'll use it again,' she told DNAInfo. 'Maybe I'll do it if it'll be somebody else's credit card.' The company has since pledged to refund the entire cost of her ride. A spokesman said: 'We apologize to this rider for any inconvenience and we have provided them with a full refund.'","Jaime Hessel claimed her driver cut across lanes and drove in a bus lane .

8729,"This is the moment a paedophile was caught by police after grooming a girl he believed to be 14 on the internet. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli, who is of Afghani origin, was snared by a paedophile vigilante group called Letzgo Hunting. Married Adeli, 32, arranged to meet someone he believed to be a young teenage girl after engaging in sexual conversations online and sending an indecent image of himself. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli who was arrested at a bus station in Leicester after thinking he was going to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex . Adeli had been duped by paedophile vigilante group Letzgo Hunting and police were waiting to arrest him when he turned up at the bus station . The vigilante group filmed the meeting, which showed Adeli putting his head in his hands when he realised he had been tricked . Adeli agreed to pay for 'Amy's' bus fare to make the 13-mile journey from Hinckley, Leicestershire, to Leicester, where they had arranged to meet. When he arrived, he had three condoms in his pocket. But instead of being greeted by a schoolgirl, Adeli was confronted by police who arrested him immediately while the vigilante group filmed his reaction. The video of his arrest on December 10 has been posted on Facebook and viewed more than 10,000 times. In the footage, Adeli is asked to show his identification to police as he looks up at the officer in disbelief. He pauses before telling officers his name. The officer says: 'I am arresting you on arranging and facilitating child sex offences.' Adeli bows his head and puts his hands over his face before he is led away by police. On Wednesday Adeli was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after he admitted attempting to meet a girl under 16 after grooming her online. 'Amy' was in fact a vigilante named John who was pretending to be a young girl. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, told the court: 'The man, John, acts as a self-appointed paedophile hunter carrying out covert internet investigations, trying to identify and expose those who would prey on children using the internet. 'He and colleagues used to film such confrontations and put them on the internet, but now they've changed their way of handling matters and contact the police when there's been a meeting arranged.' Mr Murphy said the vigilante had set up a bogus online profile in December claiming to belong to a girl called Amy from Hinckley. Within days, Adeli had made contact and the pair started talking online and exchanged texts and images on their mobiles. The court was told that Adeli had thought he had been chatting to a schoolgirl named Amy, when in fact he had been talking to a member of Letzgo Hunting called John . Yesterday he was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after admitting attempting to meet a girl under 16 for grooming . Although Amy's profile said she was 18, Mr Murphy said that during the conversations the man who was posing as Amy made it clear that she was in fact 14. Adeli claimed to be 28. During the online chats, 'Amy' said: 'Sorry, you're too old for me.' The prosecutor said Adeli replied: 'I know, but we can be friends and talk.' Mr Murphy added: 'The conversation became sexual, with the defendant leading the way. He asked if she would perform sex acts upon him, suggesting it in the most explicit terms. They made arrangements to meet after two days.' Navinder Sekhon, defending, described the meeting as a 'preparatory offence and not a completed one' and said that Adeli felt 'deep-seated remorse'. Mr Sekhon told the court that Adeli cared for his sick wife and 'wishes to be reunited with her'. Adeli, who has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK, was placed on a ten-year sexual offences prevention order. Judge Philip Head, sentencing said: 'It was your intention to have full sexual activity with someone you believed to be 14 and something you know to be a crime in this country. 'You were grooming this person for sexual activity.' The Letzgo Hunting group has caught dozens of paedophiles by posing as young girls online, arranging meetings and then alerting the police. In court Mr Murphy said it had been 'made clear' that the police didn't support the group's actions but once they had been given information about an offence they had to investigate it. Adeli has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK and was also placed on a 10 year sexual offences prevention order .","Jafar Adeli thought he had been chatting to a 14-year-old girl he met online .

A thug has been jailed after he mugged his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a £10 note. Bradley Dew, 26, had been drinking with his friend at a pub in Faversham in Kent earlier that day and had borrowed his mobile. But later in the evening Dew returned to his friend's home, claiming he had lost the mobile on a train after returning from Herne Bay. As the friend said he was about to go out with his girlfriend, Dew pushed him back into a wall before striking him across the face. He then stole £10 out of his wallet. Dew, of Faversham, then fled the scene, and was found by police hiding in the toilets of a pub close to his friend's home hours later on March 29 last year. Officers said he was likely to have been left feeling vulnerable after being mugged in his own home. Dew denied stealing from his friend, and told officers it would have been 'like robbing my brother.' However he was found guilty of robbery and assault, following a trial held at Maidstone Crown Court. Detective Constable Kathryn Lumsden-Earle, of Kent Police, said: 'Dew took advantage of a so-called friend's generosity, taking his phone and then never returning it. 'He then acted like a bully by pushing and hitting his vulnerable victim before stealing money from his wallet. 'He did all of this in the victim's own home, which no doubt left him very frightened and scared for his safety. 'Time behind bars just might give him that opportunity to reflect on what he did that day, but more so the impact it had on someone he knew was vulnerable and who viewed him as a friend.'

Yet despite leaving the club under a cloud, Smith insists that both men have something left to offer in football, and he blames boardroom turmoil under Craig Whyte, Charles Green and the Mike Ashley-Easdale Brothers axis for contributing towards an unmanageable situation. ‘I think they want an opportunity,’ said the former Rangers manager and chairman of his two former colleagues. ‘After working with them for a number of years and them getting the opportunity to go in and take over, which I got when Graeme (Souness) left, the boys were always hoping they would get the opportunity. ‘There was no guarantee of that, but they got it, and you have got to say that the circumstances they worked under were probably the poorest of any manager at any time in Rangers’ history. ‘People can make their own judgments of how a manager does a job. All I would say is that everyone has to have support. ‘I got the support of David Murray when I was manager at Rangers and he was a big help to me. They never had that help, they didn’t get any help. ‘Stuart (McCall) has come in at a time when everybody is looking a bit brighter for a change at Rangers. It is a good time for him to come in. Stuart McCall is now in charge of the Scottish Championship side and has impressed since taking over . ‘It certainly wasn’t a good time when Alistair took over. Craig Whyte came in and that coincided with Alistair, I felt, not getting a fair opportunity. ‘It is very difficult to judge him as a manager under the circumstances that he worked in. I certainly wouldn’t have liked to have worked under them anyway.’ The McCoist legacy has drawn unfavourable comments from supporters. Signings such as Dean Shiels, David Templeton and Ian Black arrived on wages which were barely justified by their performances in a light blue shirt. Some voiced doubts over McCoist’s tactical acumen while others asked why younger players weren’t given more of a chance to blossom in the lower leagues. Yet Smith argues that both McCoist and McDowall deserve to be remembered for what they did during his own highly successful second spell at Rangers, prior to the financial tsunami which plunged the club over a fiscal cliff. ‘I was the manager, Alistair was the assistant manager and Kenny was the coach and, for four and a half years when the club was well run, we did well,’ said the former Scotland boss. Smith believes Ally McCoist deserves a chance to prove himself a successful manager at a stable club . ‘I am not a miracle person, I couldn’t run Rangers Football Club on my own. The people that I worked with there did a terrific job. I know their strengths. Everyone has got strengths and weaknesses and I know theirs. ‘I read in the paper that Ally can’t manage. He had never managed a football club before, and neither had I when I took over. ‘Imagine when you have never managed a football club before, going into Rangers and being there for four years under the circumstances that they were in? ‘People say: “He will ask Walter Smith for advice” but I had never been in that circumstance before, so how could I give him any advice in terms of how Rangers were being run? It is an unfair judgement for people to make on him because of the circumstances. McCoist is Rangers record scorer but was axed as manager amid speculation surrounding the clubs future . ‘Alistair and Kenny would take a lot of the training, and I read that he (McDowall) couldn’t coach. Kenny McDowall is a terrific coach. He is excellent at his job and one of the most organised people I have ever worked with. Yet I hear all these assessments. ‘If you don’t get results, people make those assessments, but they are not correct. ‘For me, the main circumstance is why they didn’t work out under Alistair and Kenny, who didn’t want to be the manager. The circumstances weren’t right.’","Walter Smith believes Ally McCoist deserves another managerial job .

5753,"(CNN)Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have always been thorny, but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today. Tehran and Riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the Middle East. In its most recent incarnation, the Iranian-Saudi conflict by proxy has reached Yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic. For Riyadh and its regional allies, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen -- ""Operation Decisive Storm"" -- is the moment the Sunni Arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of Shia-Iranian influence. For Tehran and its regional allies -- including the Houthi movement in Yemen -- Saudi Arabia's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable. And yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the Yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war. When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected in June 2013, he pledged to reach out to Riyadh. He was up front and called Tehran's steep deterioration of relations with the Saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on Iranian foreign policy. From Lebanon and Afghanistan to Pakistan and the Gaza Strip, the Iranian-Saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly. And yet despite Rouhani's open pledge, profound differences over Syria and Iraq in particular have kept Riyadh and Tehran apart. But if the questions of Syria and Iraq prevented a pause in hostilities, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen since late March has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels. Unlike in Syria and in Iraq, the Saudi military is now directly battling it out with Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. While Riyadh no doubt exaggerates Tehran's role in the Yemen crisis, its fingerprints are nonetheless evident. ""Iran provides financial support, weapons, training and intelligence to Houthis,"" Gerald Feierstein, a U.S. State Department official and former Yemen ambassador, told a Congressional hearing last week. ""We believe that Iran sees opportunities with the Houthis to expand its influence in Yemen and threaten Saudi and Gulf Arab interests."" The Iranians find the charges biased and point to the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor's affairs. In Iran, the cue came from the country's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been unusually blunt. He tweeted: ""Despite disputes, the Saudis used to display composure [with] us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power & replaced composure [with] barbarism."" Three days after Khamenei's speech, Iran suspended religious pilgrimages to Mecca. This came as news broke about two Iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, anti-Saudi protests have been staged in a number of Iranian cities. Khamenei's speech opened the floodgate of anti-Saudi statements. The voices of hardline figures in Tehran have been the most agitated. General Ahmad Purdastan, the commander of the Iranian ground forces, taunted the Saudis. ""Beware of the day when firecrackers explode in Riyadh,"" Purdastan said, in a not-so-subtle warning. But it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the Saudis. Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and arguably Iran's most vocal advocate of better Iranian-Saudi relations. called Riyadh's military intervention a ""strategic mistake"" and urged for a political solution. Seeking a political solution is Iran's stated aim for the Yemeni crisis, but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has provided a four-point plan: to get a ceasefire, to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid, to promote political dialogue among warring Yemeni parties, and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government. But the Iranian proposal also asks for an end to Saudi airstrikes. As Zarif put it, ""Iran and Saudi Arabia need to talk, but we cannot talk to determine the future of Yemen."" The Saudis have thus far ignored the Iranian proposal. Meanwhile, the Houthi leadership has welcomed the plan. As one of its leaders said, ""In Iran's plan, unacceptable solutions do not exist."" Not only do the Saudis not have any faith in any Iranian-drafted political package that is welcomed by the Houthis, but Riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it. Saudi Arabia was elated by the U.N. Security Council vote on 14 April that condemned the Houthi movement. Only Russia abstained. But a solution to the Yemeni crisis will not come from the U.N. The U.N. can provide a cover for Riyadh's military intervention, but it cannot secure it a military win. This leaves Riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in Yemen. Saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the Houthi movement and it allies in the Yemeni armed forces. It requires ground troops on a huge scale. Riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco. The Pakistanis most famously turned down the Saudi request and let it be known that Yemen is a quagmire they can do without. Instead, Islamabad has asked Iran to push the Houthis for a political compromise that Riyadh can live with. The Turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the Houthis -- but in his visit to Tehran last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized Iranian-Turkish trade relations over rivalry in Yemen, and emphasized a political solution for the Yemeni conflict. The Egyptians and the Jordanians are still supportive of Saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist Riyadh in Yemen. But whether they will go through with it is another matter. Egypt has a long list of problems of its own, including a bloody counter-terrorism campaign in Sinai that it cannot afford to lose, but also an eastern border with lawless Libya that is increasingly a new front in Cairo's fight against jihadists. It is hard to see how Egyptian General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi can commit troops to a Yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to Egypt's security. The same kind of domestic realities, including the threat from ISIS, will also prevent Jordan from any significant contribution to Saudi military efforts in Yemen. These hard realities leave Riyadh with two options. It can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same Houthis that Riyadh is attacking today. Alternatively, given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops, Riyadh will have to contemplate a full-scale invasion of Yemen. That is scenario that is very hard to contemplate. The Iranians too are faced with stark choices. It is beyond Tehran's ability to tame the Yemeni crisis. As tempting as it might be for Tehran to see the Saudis bleed in Yemen, the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the Middle East will undermine broader regional Iranian interests. A political compromise that both Riyadh and Tehran and their respective Yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic.","Vatanka: Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia are at an unprecedented level .

1590,"Nearly one in four teenagers are ‘almost constantly’ online as their lives are swallowed up ever more by their mobile phones, a study has revealed. Some 24 per cent of 13 to 17-year-olds admitted they were continuously checking their devices, including when they were at school. Nine in teenagers also confessed to going online every day as they were unable to resist the lure of Facebook and Instagram. In danger? The study also looked at social media and found that middle class teenagers were more likely to use Snapchat, the controversial message service where messages disappears seconds after they are sent . Parents now find it increasingly difficult to monitor their children's online behaviour as more than 70 per cent of teens use now more than one social network. The study was carried out on American teenagers but the findings would likely be worse in the UK as more British teenagers own smartphones than their US counterparts. The Pew Research Centre asked 1,060 children aged between 13 and 17 about their phone habits. The report found that what Pew described as a  ‘frenzy of access’ was facilitated by mobile phones - particularly smartphones. Of the 92 per cent of teens who went online every day, more than half said that meant using their phones several times a day. Some 12 per cent admitted to using a gadget once a day, six per cent said they went online just once a week and a mere two per cent said it was less than that. Addicted: Overall Facebook remains the most used social media site among teens with 71 per cent using it . In the largest ever systematic study of emails - examining more than 16 billion messages - researchers have found that most people send replies containing just five words. The study, which was conducted by researchers at Yahoo Labs and the University of Southern California, also found that our email habits also follow remarkable patterns. Replies become faster as the conversation progresses, but the researchers found they could tell when a email thread was about to end as the last reply was much slower than the previous replies. 'The long delay in a reply could be considered as a signal for the end of the conversation,' said the researchers, led by Farshad Kooti, a computer scientist at the University of Southern California. The study examined the emails sent by two million Yahoo users over a period of several months. They found that on average younger people tend to spend less time composing an email - with a reply time of around 13 minutes on average for teenagers. Young adults take 16 minutes, while those aged 36 to 50 years old spend around 24 minutes before sending their reply. Phone ownership was almost ubiquitous among young people, meaning they grow up used to being able to access anything any time they want. The Pew study found that nearly three-quarters of teens have access to a smartphone. Some 30 per cent have a basic phone and just 12 per cent of 13 to 17-year-olds have no phone of any kind. The study also looked at social media and found that middle class teenagers were more likely to use Snapchat, the controversial message service where the text and images disappears seconds after they are sent. The service has been blamed for a rise in ‘sexting’, where young people send explicit pictures to each other. Overall Facebook remains the most used social media site among teens with 71 per cent using it. Amanda Lenhart, the lead author and associate director of research at the Pew Research Centre, said: ‘There’s been a huge diversification of social media. ‘If you are wondering where your child is, you probably need to cast a wide net, because there is a variety of places where your teen could be spending his or her social media time’ Previous studies have starkly illustrated the extent to which young people are addicted to their mobiles. Smartphone users check their devices an average of 150 times a day as they cannot bear to be apart from them, one research paper showed. The study showed that we are so addicted to their mobiles that we cannot go 10 minutes without fiddling around with them.","9 in 10 teens go online every day, unable to resist the lure of Facebook .

1510,"A Western gray whale has made the longest known migration by any mammal. The female, named Varvara, swam 14,000 miles (22,500km) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back, without even stopping for a snack when she was nine years old. Her return journey across the North Pacific raises questions about the critically endangered creature’s conservation status. A Western gray whale (pictured) has made the longest known migration by any mammal. The female, named Varvara, swam 14,000 miles (22,500) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back, reportedly without stopping for a snack . Until now, scientists believed there were two distinct groups of gray whale - the Eastern gray whale, which travels along the west coast of US, and the much rarer Western gray whale, which journeys along the coast of eastern Asia. The researchers used satellite-monitoring tags to track three Western North Pacific gray whales from their primary feeding ground off Russia’s Sakhalin Island across the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the US to Baja, Mexico. The experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of Russia for years and tracked the record-breaking journey over five-and-half months between 2011 and 2012. Gray whales typically don't feed during migration, which has led researchers to believe Varvara didn't eat during the long journey either. They found that Varvara, which is Russian for Barbara, visited the three major breeding areas for Eastern gray whales, which are found off North America, according to the study published by the Royal Society in the journal Biology Letters. Her return journey across the North Pacific raises questions about the critically endangered creature’s conservation status. Experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of Russia for years and tracked the record-breaking journey between 2011 and 2012. A Western gray whale is shown . ‘It is very impressive,’ Professor Bruce Mate, of Oregon State University, told MailOnline. ‘These whales have the same body temperature as you and I, so they are obliged to make these big journeys to get to warmer or cooler waters. But this is a record.’ ‘Until now we thought they were not very good navigators,’ he continued. Varvarva is a 13-year-old Western gray whale. She is now famous for making the longest migration of any mammal when she was aged nine. The whale was tagged off Russia's Sakhalin Island in September 2011. Experts expected her to swim along Asia's Pacific shoreline down to the South China Sea. But instead, she turned up off Mexico's Baja Peninsula instead and mingled with Eastern gray whales near their nursery lagoon in Mexico. Experts tracked Varvara to find that she made a swam 14,000 miles (22,500) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back. Her journey is helping scientists make a surprising new discovery about migration patterns. ‘We thought that they just stuck to the coast, keeping the sound of the surf on one side, going up and down the coast until they met their destination.' On the way from Russia she is believed to have crossed the northern extremity of the Bering Sea, before hitting Alaska and going south until she reached the warm seas off the Baja peninsula to breed. But on her way back to Russia, she made a more direct route, cutting across deep water. ‘We do not know how she did it but the fact that she took different routes each way means we have to accept that these whales are very accomplished navigators,’ Professor Mate continued. The study said: ‘Her 22,511 km round-trip is the longest documented mammal migration and strongly suggests that some presumed Western gray whales are actually Eastern gray whales foraging in areas historically attributed to Wester gray whales.’ The previous longest journey made by a mammal was held by a humpback whale, who swam more than 11,706 miles (18,839km) in 2011. The migration from the feeding grounds was also made by two other whales who were being monitored, called Flex and Agent, who were all tagged seven years ago. Western gray whales were thought to have gone extinct by the 1970s before a small population was discovered in Russia off Sakhalin Island. The group is now estimated to be 150 strong and has been monitored by scientists from Russia and the US since the 1990s. The migration from the feeding grounds was also made by two other whales who were being monitored, called Flex and Agent, who were all tagged seven years ago. Here, experts observe the animals breaching . Like their western cousins, Eastern gray whales were decimated by whaling and listed as endangered, but conservation efforts led to their recovery. There are now thought to be more than 18,000 of them swimming the oceans. But not all scientists believe that Western gray whales are a separate, distinct species, raising the possibility that only Eastern gray whales survive today. Scientists previously thought that gray whales 'hugged' the coastlines, either in Asia or North America. They thought they set their path by watching or listening to the shore. The whales learn their migratory route from their mothers, who take them on their first journey from the breeding grounds to more northern feeding grounds and repeat the journey the following year. But Varvara travelled to Russia by swimming across the Bering Sea, with few landmarks or shallow waters to guide her. She even swam a new path on the way back by following the Alaskan coast. One of the routes is thought to have been passed on by her mother, demonstrating previously unknown navigational skills. ‘The fact that endangered Western gray whales have such a long range and interact with Eastern gray whales was a surprise and leaves a lot of questions up in the air,’ said Bruce Mate, director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University and lead author on the study. ‘Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look.’ Valentin Ilyashenko of the A.N Severtsov Institute for Ecology and Evolution, who is the Russian representative to the International Whaling Commission and co-author of the study, has proposed since 2009 that recent western and Eastern gray whale populations are not isolated. He said that the gray whales found in Russian waters are a part of an eastern population that is restoring its former historical range. ‘The ability of the whales to navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive and suggests that some Western gray whales might actually be eastern grays,’ Dr Mate said. ‘But that doesn’t mean that there may not be some true Western gray whales remaining. ‘If so, then the number of true Western gray whales is even smaller than we previously thought.’ Protecting the endangered Western gray whales has been difficult, with five whales dying in Japanese fishing nets within the last decade. Their feeding areas off Japan and Russia include fishing areas, shipping lanes, and oil and gas production, as well as future sites oil sites, while their largely unknown migration routes may include additional hazards.","Western gray whales were tagged seven years ago to monitor migration .

The statement Nineties chop, made famous by Jim Carrey’s Lloyd Christmas in Dumb And Dumber, has graced the heads of celebrities far and wide in recent years - from Rihanna and Robert Pattinson to Lena Dunham and Miley Cyrus - and is spreading like wildfire among hipsters. One chain of British barber shops has reported a whopping 200 per cent surge in requests for the almost universally unflattering cut, with men queuing around the corner for their turn to get the snip.

'We’ve even had women coming into the barbers asking for the traditionally male style. It’s fast becoming the 2015 hipster trend.' The craze may have been fuelled in part by the release of Dumb And Dumber To, the recent sequel to the 1994 cult hit, in which Jim Carrey hung on to his character's trademark chop. Indeed, Twilight heartthrob Rob Pattinson surprised everyone last November when he adopted the bowl cut, the same month the film came out.

Girls star Lena Dunham drew a similar gasp from commentators last year when she unveiled her own platinum blonde version on Instagram, stating: 'Change is good.' Miley Cyrus has also enjoyed a brief flirtation with the bowl cut, hers being eerily similar in nature to the one sported by Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter back in the Nineties, when Miley was just a child. And who could forget Justin Bieber, who burst onto the scene in 2007 with a sweepy bowl cut so beloved by his fans that he broke hearts around the world when he later chopped it off. Other brave stars to have tried the style on for size over the years include Rihanna, Kelis, Jessie J, Agnes Deyn and Kelly Osbourne. What's more, says Mr Nobbs, another Nineties style is also becoming increasingly popular, although 'the classic curtains style' still has some way to go before it hits the heights of the bowl cut. 'We've seen a bit of a resurgence from that Nineties style as well,' he explains. 'The classic curtains have been spotted recently on the likes of Liam Hemsworth, Zayn Malik and Johnny Depp as well.' Lena Dunham surprised her fans last year when she unveiled her own platinum blonde version on Instagram, stating, 'Change is good' Agyness Deyn was famed for her raven version  in 2010 .

Infantino said: 'Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference. 'There are currently three other countries, outside of Europe, which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football. 'Don't forget that it will affect more than the national team.

Having been linked with a string of the world's most famous beauties - Angelina Jolie, Demi Moore, Britney Spears, Elizabeth Taylor - the actor says he's now hung up his prowling boots. In fact, the 38-year-old has confessed in an interview with The Sunday Times that not only is he too busy, but he's not even interested in the chase any longer. Scroll down for video . Colin Farrell has claimed that he's no longer the womaniser we once knew, and hasn't dated in four years . The 38-year-old actor says that he's now focusing on resurrecting his acting career (pictured here in the upcoming second series of True Detective) and being a good father to his two sons James and Henry . What's occupying so much time for the man who was once nicknamed the 'Lusty Leprechaun'? The Irish actor is about to experience something of a comeback with a role in the much-anticipated second series of HBO's True Detective. He's also the face of the new Dolce & Gabbana fragrance Intenso. However he insists that his time now is dedicated to clean living and seeing his two sons James Padraig, 11, and Henry Tadeusz, five. It's a far more wholesome lifestyle for Colin who confesses he's glad that his drink and drug-fuelled days are behind him. He's now branded his arrival in Hollywood circa 2002 as 'too much' to handle in his early 20s, and he's now not only completely sober - he even enjoys a spot of yoga. Britney Spears accompanied Colin Farrell to the premiere of film The Recruit during the height of his party-hard lifestyle. The pair both denied any romance however, claiming they were 'just mates' And his love life is firmly on the backburner. Asked if he had any women his life, he replied: 'There is not one - zilch, nada.' Even more surprising however, is that after years of being labelled a womaniser, his now celibate - and happy with his unattached status. 'I have not dated for, ooh, four years now. It's just not happening, what with the work, the kids and my life. 'I know it's not what people expect to hear, but that's the honest truth.' The actor is now a devoted dad and although they live with their mothers (James with model Kim Bordenave and Henry with ex-wife Alicja Bachleda-Curus) he sees the boys every weekend. He told the Sunday Times's Style magazine: 'It's not all about you any more, which is a relief. It's about a bigger world, and helping them find their place in it. 'It's not about  ""me, me, me, the loudmouth"" any more - and that takes the pressure off me to live up to those old expectations'. He is especially protective of James, who has a developmental disorder called Angelman syndrome, which causes intellectual and physical disability.

He and Jamie Dornan's wife Amelia Warner 'married' in a non-legally binding ceremony in Tahiti in 2001, the following year he dated Canadian model Kim, and conceived their child James. By the next year he was linked with Demi Moore, although they've both denied the affair and in 2003, Britney Spears accompanied him to the premiere of his film The Recruit but any intimate acquaintance didn't last with Colin insisting they were 'just mates'. Angelina Jolie is rumoured to have come on to him during the filming of Alexander in 2003, and he is said to have offered to read Dame Eileen Atkins, who was then 70, a book in bed. She refused. After Elizabeth Taylor's death in 2011 Colin admitted to being 'romantically' involved with the actress . Doting daddy: Colin Farrell has spoken in the past about how he has learnt to cope with his eleven-year-old son James' condition - Angelman Syndrome, a neuro-genetic disorder which can affect brain development . In 2006 the womaniser was enmeshed in legal proceedings over a leaked sex tape during a brief relationship with former Playboy model Nicole Narain. And three years later he met Alicja on the set of Ondine. They had baby Henry together in 2010 bu split up soon after. The Minority Report star's most bizarre liaison, however, was with Elizabeth Taylor in the last years of her life. He called her 'a spectacular woman' and described the relationship as 'romantic' and when she died in 2011, he read a poem at her funeral.

Last month the West Indies opener posted 'I'm not leaving' alongside an Instagram video of himself singing along with an amused singer in Sydney after rejecting speculation that he will quit international cricket. Gayle, laughing while attempting to hit the high notes as the singer covers Sam Smith's 'Stay With Me', is no doubt referring to the picturesque Opera Bar on Sydney Harbour at which he was clearly enjoying himself. Despite his off-the-field pleasures, Gayle will be hoping that he and his Bangalore team-mates are signing from the same hymn sheet when they start their IPL campaign. The Challengers travel to the Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday looking to make amends for the past three years where they have missed out on the play-offs altogether. Possessing a potent batting order that includes Gayle, AB de Villers and Virat Kohli - the £1.17million purchase of Dinesh Karthik in addition could see them finally shake off their underachievers tag.

10843,"Winning the league championship used to be the ultimate achievement for any manager and make him bombproof for many years to come. That's not the case today. Incredibly, the last four mangers to have won the Premier League have all left their jobs by the following year – three sacked and one retired. And on the latest evidence, it will be no surprise if Manuel Pellegrini becomes number five this summer. A dejected Manuel Pellegrini following Manchester City's 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday night . Pellegrini guided City to their second Premier League title in three seasons back in May . But Pellegrini's City side were humbled at Selhurst Park on Monday to kill off any remaining title hopes . City sit fourth after the defeat, nine points adrift of leaders Chelsea, who retain a game in hand . WIN THE LEAGUE..AND THEN OUT . JOSE MOURINHO (CHELSEA) Won Premier League in 2006; sacked 2007 . Jose Mourinho ended Chelsea's 50-year wait to be champions by winning the Premier League in his first season 2004/05, and then retained the trophy the following season. But as his reputation soared, his relationship with owner Roman Abramovich soured and he left in September 2007 despite having three years left on his contract. Despite domestic success, Abramovich craved the Champions League and had become frustrated with the team's defensive style. For his part, Mourinho felt belittled by having players signed on Abramovich's say-so, most notably Andriy Shevchenko who was a declining force.

CARLO ANCELOTTI (CHELSEA) Won PL in 2010; sacked 2011 . Carlo Ancelotti led Chelsea to their first league and FA Cup Double in his first season, scoring a record number of goals that still stands today. However, he failed to win a trophy in his second season and that was enough for Abramovich to pull the trigger despite finishing second in the table. Ancelotti knew the game was up as he puffed on a cigarette and chatted to David Moyes after Chelsea had lost the final game of the season 1-0 at Everton. The Italian bounced back to win the Champions League with Real Madrid last season and will be among the contenders for the City job should Pellegrini leave.

Ancelotti departed Stamford Bridge a year later after failing to win silverware in his second season . ROBERTO MANCINI (MANCHESTER CITY) Won PL in 2012; sacked 2013 . Mancini ended City's 44-year wait for the league title when Sergio Aguero scored against QPR on the final minute of the final day of the season. Yet his controversial approach led to him falling out with Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli, and criticising Adam Johnson and Joe Hart, and when City failed to win a trophy the following season and failed in the Champions League, the Italian was out. His demise was widely reported on the morning of the FA Cup Final against Wigan Athletic. City fans chanted Mancini's name but they lost the final and he was dismissed the following week.

Ferguson won a record 13th title and walked away into the sunset after the final game of the season, a remarkable 5-5 draw at West Brom. The United boss said later he had wanted to retire the previous season but City's title win persuaded him to carry on for another year and wrestle the trophy back – which he did. Ferguson helped pick David Moyes as his successor but he grew disillusioned with his fellow Scot after Moyes got rid of his assistant Mike Phelan and built a team around Wayne Rooney.

2791,"Scientists have discovered an Achilles’ heel of prostate (pictured) cancer that could lead to better treatment for many  men diagnosed with the disease . British scientists have discovered an ‘Achilles’ heel’ in prostate cancer which could lead to better treatments. The disease claims almost 11,000 lives a year in the UK, with most deaths occurring after it spreads around the body. The latest study gets to the root of this spread, and could mean better outcomes for the 42,000 men a year diagnosed with the illness. Scientists funded by Cancer Research UK studied samples taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten affected men. Reading the DNA revealed details of how the cancer metastasises, or spreads, allowing them to build a ‘family tree’ of how the disease changes over time. It seems that most of the cells in a tumour stay where they are. However, a small number have the ability to travel through the body, creating new tumours as they go. These cells are the ‘root’ of the cancer and for a treatment to work, they should be destroyed. In future, doctors may be able to find these key cells in individual patients. They could then be given drugs to wipe them out, with each patient’s treatment tailored to the genetic flaw at the root of their cancer. This should kill the new tumours and prevent more from forming, greatly improving odds of survival. Cambridge University researcher Professor David Neal said some suitable drugs already exist, and that new ones are being developed all the time. However, he cautioned that it will be three to five years before the latest knowledge can be routinely put to use in the NHS. Lead study author Professor Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: ‘We gained a much broader view of prostate cancer by studying both the original cancer and the cells that had spread to other parts of the body. ‘We found that all of the cells that had broken free shared a common ancestor cell in the prostate. ‘The common faults we found in each man could potentially offer new targets for treatment.’ Co-author Dr Ultan McDermott, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, described the finding as a ‘potential Achilles’ heel’. Professor Peter Johnson, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This research lets us look right into the molecular core of cancer.’ Samples were taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten men with the disease (pictured). Reading the DNA revealed details of how the cancer metastasises - or spreads - allowing scientists to understand how the disease changes over time .","British scientists say they have got to the 'root' of prostate cancer .

9524,"Liverpool's players must focus on getting themselves and the club into the semi-finals of the FA Cup rather than Steven Gerrard, according to Reds legend Robbie Fowler. Gerrard will leave Anfield at the end of the season to join Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy and the skipper is hoping to bow out in style by leading Brendan Rodgers' side to the final at Wembley. But ahead of Wednesday night's quarter-final replay with Blackburn, Fowler has warned Gerrard's team-mates not to concentrate on providing the 34-year-old with a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) trains alongside Rickie Lambert at Melwood on Monday . Gerrard will miss Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final replay with Blackburn because of suspension . Reds legend Robbie Fowler, pictured with Kenny Dalglish, says Liverpool's players must not focus on Gerrard . Fowler told goal.com: 'Everyone would absolutely love Steven to win it, what with this being his last season and possibly last game, and hopefully that will be the case. 'But Liverpool have got to get themselves into the position where they can't do this just for Steven Gerrard. They've got to do it for every individual involved with the club. That's the way it should be.' Gerrard will miss the trip to Ewood Park as he serves the second match of a three-game suspension and Fowler hopes that Jordan Henderson and Co put their missing captain to the back of their minds . 'If you put too much effort in for one man, maybe you can get a little bit too excited or overboard,' added Fowler. 'As much as it would be Steven's last game, they've got to get past that and just do it for themselves. 'In an ideal world, they'll do it, and no-one would love it more than me. Steven deserves to go out on a high but they've got to do it for themselves. It's not all about Steven.' Fowler has also urged Raheem Sterling to end his contract wrangle and commit his future to the club after he rejected a new deal worth £100,000-a-week. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has rejected a new £100,000-a-week deal to stay at Anfield . Fowler believes Sterling, pictured training on Monday, should stay at Liverpool to develop his game . Writing in his column for the Daily Mirror, Fowler said: 'I think it’s nonsense to suggest Sterling will have to go elsewhere to win trophies and fulfil all these dreams he’s apparently got. 'In the space of two seasons, with a very, very young team that will only get better, they should have won the league, should have beaten Chelsea in a semi to get to Wembley... and should play in an FA Cup Final there in May. 'I was brought up at Anfield and still work there, so what else am I going to think?, but he’d be crazy to go at this stage in his development, especially because he’s being guided by a special manager who has already turned Luis Suarez into one of the best players in the world... and earned Luis the money to go with that status.'","Liverpool face Blackburn in an FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday .

11062,"Two birds of prey have been caught on camera brutally fighting over a nesting box, staring each other down before attacking each other with sharp talons and beaks. A kestrel and a barn owl repeatedly lunged at each other while trying to gain mastery of the box so they could lay eggs and rear their young in safety. And despite the owl's cuddly reputation, it came out the victor, forcing the kestrel to seek an alternative home for itself and its mate. Face-off: A barn owl and a kestrel have been caught on camera fighting in a nesting box . Conflict: The two birds of prey lunged at each other in a vicious scrap . The fight was captured on video by wildlife photographer Robert Fuller, using a camera he set up inside a 13ft-high elm tree stump in his garden in Thixendale, North Yorkshire. He said that a pair of kestrels had been guarding the nesting box in the tree, but when they left in the evening a barn owl swooped in and laid a claim to the nest. After the owl drove the kestrels away he managed to attract a mate to share his new home - but the kestrels found an alternative nesting box in Mr Fuller's garden. The cameras were set up as part of an exhibition at Mr Fuller's gallery, monitoring the nest of blackbirds, blue tits and pheasants as well as birds of prey. Confrontation: The kestrel was attempting to win back the nesting box after guarding it all day . Flurry: A video camera captured the vicious fight, with the two birds throwing themselves at each other . On top: At one point the kestrel had the owl up against the wall of the box inside an old tree stump . Mr Fuller said: 'The nest has been used in the past by tawny owls and this year the kestrels were showing a lot of interest in it. 'The female was guarding it during the day then in the evening a male barn owl started coming in and calling for a mate. 'The kestrel and barn owl battle is absolutely spectacular footage. It's much more exciting than any soap or drama on TV. 'In the footage you can see the barn owl lands and the kestrel comes right behind and hits so hard it knocks it inside and into the nest wall. 'Both birds are very well equipped to kill things, they have very sharp talons. They often have disputes in the air but here they were in a very confined space. Turnaround: Despite the kestrel's more aggressive reputation, the barn owl ended up defeating it . Victor: At the end of the video the owl can be seen admiring its new home . 'At the beginning the barn owl was looking for an escape route but the male kestrel keeps appearing at the opening. 'Kestrels have a terrier mentality, they're aggressive. Barn owls aren't really but they do have very long legs and talons, it was a fairly even battle. 'The kestrels have been here since 2006 and I feed them in the garden, they're like part of the family. But the barn owl is my favourite bird and I wanted them to nest here too. I didn't want either of them to get injured. 'The barn owl won, he's found a mate now and the kestrels are in a different nesting box in my garden. The female is guarding it day and night, she's not going to get caught out again.' Barn owls and kestrels are both attracted to nests which overlook open land, meaning that it is fairly common for them to compete for the same nesting space.","Two birds of prey fought each other in a North Yorkshire garden .

5521,"Gordon Robson, 26, killed grandfather John Potts, 45, with a single punch to the back of the head that was so hard it made an 'audible crack' A thug who was drunk after his grandfather's funeral killed a devoted father with a single punch after he stepped in to break up a fight outside a sports bar. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Gordon Robson, 26, hit father John Potts, 45, in the back of the head so hard there was an 'audible crack' before he fell down dead. Robson, who has a history of violent offending, was jailed for just three and a half years for the attack outside the NE38 Sports Bar in Washington, Tyne and Wear, in November last year. The court was told that Robson had been drinking at the bar after being a pallbearer at his grandfather's funeral before getting into an argument with a friend of Mr Potts. Fighting broke out after the bar closed, and Mr Potts, a father-of-six and grandfather-of-one who was described by his sister as 'a big softie', stepped in to stop it. Prosecutor Nick Dry told the court: 'At this point the defendant punched Mr Potts, who had been trying to calm matters down and was actually facing the other way when the blow was struck. 'The punch made a loud crack, witnesses turned to see him falling to the ground, making no attempt to break his fall.' The court heard despite intervention from the emergency services, Mr Potts could not be saved. Mr Dry added: 'Mr Potts had been minding his own business. He was an innocent bystander who sought only to calm the situation down.' Mr Potts' widow Sarah said  his death had a 'devastating impact' on the family. She said Mr Potts' stepchildren and eight-year-old daughter, Emma, now fear their family won't come back whenever they leave the house. Mr Dry added: 'She said he was a father who never judged her, he was just her dad and hero.' Mr Potts' sisters said in their statements the 'life and soul has been ripped from their family' and described their brother as a 'big softie'. Mr Potts' brother George said he wakes every Sunday at 5.30am, the time he was informed of his siblings death, and feels life has been changed forever. Robson had been drinking at the NE38 Sports Bar in Washington, Tyne and Wear, after his grandfather's funeral when fighting broke out. Mr Potts, described as a 'big softie', was killed when he tried to intervene . Judge Paul Sloan QC jailed Robson, of Waskerley Way, Washington, Tyne and Wear, who admitted manslaughter, to three-and-a-half years behind bars. The judge told Robson: 'Mr Potts was trying to calm the situation. He was acting as a peacemaker. 'It is clear Mr Potts was a devoted father and step-father. It is also clear his death has had a profound effect upon his family. 'No sentence imposed upon you could ever serve to ease the pain of Mr Potts' family. 'I accept you are genuinely remorseful and I accept you will carry the guilt with you for the rest of your life for what you did that night.' Robson accepted he 'misinterpreted' Mr Robson's actions that night, when his already emotional state had been heightened by alcohol, and realises now he should not have hit him. Bob Spragg, defending, said Robson, who has a history of violent offending dating back to when he was just 14, had turned his life around after his last prison sentence . He added that Robson had also found himself a partner who is about to give birth. Mr Spragg said: 'Absolutely no blame attaches to Mr Potts for anything that happened to him. 'Once the defendant has served his sentence he will return to being a law abiding citizen but will have to live with what he has done for the rest of his life.'","Gordon Robson, 26, was drinking at NE38 Sports Bar, in Tyne and Wear .

10234,"Saturday Night Live poked fun at Hillary Clinton just hours before she is set to announce she is running for president, by mocking her decision to tell the world via social media. The former Secretary of State, played by Kate McKinnon, and one of her advisers, played by Vanessa Bayer, discuss how she will declare her intentions at noon on Sunday following years of speculation. The pair decide to record a cellphone video of the Democrat for her campaign launch in a bid to make her come across as soft and approachable, following concerns she will not be able to relate to ordinary voters. During the scene, which includes a cameo from her husband Bill, they insist her second run at the White House will be about the people and not centered around her. But, despite desperate attempts to not be self-centered, Clinton seems incapable of talking about anyone but herself and brushes off her potential competitors. The show took aim at the 67-year-old as she is expected to reveal via video that she is taking another stab at what she believes is 'the highest and hardest glass ceiling'. Saturday Night Live skewered the news that Hillary Clinton would be announcing her presidential campaign on social media this week . The show portrayed the former Secretary of State as aggressive and driven, saying things like; 'Citizens, you will elect me' Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Former US President Bill Clinton at a 2013 event. It is believed she will have a string of celebrity backers for her second White House bid . Barack Obama has already given her his backing by saying he believes she will be an 'excellent president', but the comedians on the NBC show latched onto a memo that was made public on Saturday, saying her campaign will be humble and about 'everyday Americans'. After decades in the public eye, and stints in political offices, she faces a challenge showing her more down-to-earth side. On her first try at recording the video she screams in a dictatorial manner: 'Citizens, you will elect me. I will be your leader.' For the second attempt, they try to get Clinton to stop saying 'I' or her name, but she also fails immediately. 'Hello, 'tis I, Hillary Clinton,' she says. The two women are then joined by Bill Clinton (Darrel Hammond), who sneaks up behind his wife as she is filming. He says how grateful he is that camera phones did not exist when he was president - because he would probably be in jail if they were. The former president tells America in his wife's video: 'Hillary would make a great president. And I would make an even greater first dude.' From there they decide to make talk about how difficult the election will be, and the tough challenges Clinton will face from other Democrats. She starts talking about potential rival Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor, but the starts laughing, saying: 'He sounds like a Simpsons character.' Her husband makes a second appearance at this point with his saxophone, playing the theme tune to The Simpsons and revealing that he will be his wife's Vice President. He adds that when she dies it will be 'Bill Clinton 2: Bigger and blacker.' After trying to quiet her husband, Clinton gives in and says; 'Who are we kidding? Buckle up America, cause the Clintons are back.' She then goes over one more problem she has with her adviser - the fact she cannot be her own vice president. Bill Clinton was also featured in the skit, urging America to elect Hillary so he could be her vice president. He adds that he will make a great 'First Dude' Once she formally announces her campaign, Clinton, like all major presidential hopefuls, will no doubt be making an appearance on the show, which this week was hosted by Empire star Tarji P. Henson. However she has been targeted by Saturday Night Live many times before. Just four weeks ago she was skewered on opening sketch following revelations over her personal emails. At the beginning of a mock interview the politician describes herself as a 'relatable woman on a couch'. 'Those emails are as clean as a whistle. What did you think those emails said? 'Hey it's Hilary I really screwed up on Benghazi'.' Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley took to Twitter on Sunday after the actress playing Clinton compared him to a 'Simpsons character' during the sketch . Referencing her probable run for president, she also insists: 'There will be no mistakes in my rise to the top.' Speaking about the release of the emails, following pressure from her opponents and the media, she says: 'Go ahead, read them, you won't find squat.' When she announces she will likely become the overwhelming favorite to win her party's nomination, with no stiff opponents expected to face her in the primaries. She will inevitably have a number of celebrity backers who will stage fundraisers for her in the coming months with reports suggesting she is looking to raise $1.1billion - double the amount Obama spent on his re-election campaign in 2012. Among them are high-profile Hollywood backers including director Steven Spielberg, and actors George Clooney, Barbra Streisand and Tom Hanks. The November 2016 election will emphasize her plans to address economic inequality and will tout the historic nature of her bid to become the first woman U.S. president, aides have said. 'Who are we kidding? Buckle up America, cause the Clintons are back,' says Hillary in the end of the skit . Clinton will also have to quell a controversy over her work use of a private email account while secretary of state, which Republicans have said is a sign of her penchant for secrecy. Clinton has said she used the single email account for convenience and should have used government email, but violated no rules. Clinton, who lost a heavyweight Democratic nominating battle to Barack Obama in 2008, will announce her campaign on video and social media, a Democrat familiar with her plans said. She will travel later in the week to Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest in early 2016. In a memo made public on Saturday, Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook told staff while the goal was for Clinton to win the presidency, the campaign was not about her. 'We are humble: we take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always out-compete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states,' he said in the campaign memo, titled 'We Are Hillary for America.' Many Democrats have eagerly awaited Sunday's announcement since the day in June 2008 when Clinton pulled out of her primary battle against Obama with an expression of regret that she could not crack 'that highest and hardest glass ceiling this time.' Opinion polls show Clinton has a huge lead over potential 2016 Democratic rivals, and few are expected to enter the race. A Reuters-Ipos tracking poll shows Clinton backed by more than 60 percent of Democrats. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of liberals but who says she is not running, is a distant second at 18 percent. So far, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and former U.S. Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, whose support languishes in single digits in polls, are the most prominent contenders to take steps toward challenging her. Republicans have been gearing up for the battle, and a big field of Republican presidential contenders is expected. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky have been the first to formally enter the race, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will jump in on Monday. Clinton operatives have already begun reaching out to top bundlers to urge them to start calling people in their donor networks, a source familiar with the matter said. At least one West Coast bundler began making calls to top donors this past week, and will place another round of calls after the announcement Sunday, the source said. She also intends to sell herself as being able to work with Congress, businesses and world leaders. In New York on Saturday, at the final event put on by 'Ready for Hillary,' a group not connected with her campaign that's worked for the past few years to stoke excitement for it, enthusiastic supporters joined elected officials and local party leaders to celebrate the launch to come. 'After she left the State Department she could have slipped into grandmother-hood, but people want to call her back into public service,' said Jarret Berg, 29, a Democratic staffer in the New York legislature. 'It's time for her.' As her official announcement loomed, the Republican National Committee linked Clinton to Obama, a regular focus of criticism from the GOP. 'All Hillary Clinton is offering is a continuation of the same big government ideas that have grown Washington instead of the middle class,' RNC spokesman Michael Short said in a statement Saturday. 'That's why voters want fresh leadership and a new direction, not four more years of Obama's failed policies.' Clinton (pictured on UN Woman's day on March 10 addressing the email scandal) is expected to be the clear front runner from the Democratic nomination .","Opening sketch had former First Lady and adviser discussing campaign .

Centre-backs Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo will also miss the trip to the Premier League leaders, and with Jonny Evans completing his six-match ban, Louis van Gaal described it as ‘the worst scenario’. Jones and Blind, who was injured by Vincent Kompany’s controversial challenge in the Manchester derby last weekend, both have ankle injuries while Carrick limped out of that game with a tight calf and Rojo later reported a stomach muscle problem. Michael Carrick limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo picked up an injury soon after . Louis van Gaal also revealed in his pre-match press conference that Daley Blind and Phil Jones are out . Wayne Rooney has impressed up front in recent weeks but may have to drop further back . Louis van Gaal puts his arm round Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney during training this week . Van Gaal has revealed that Rooney may play in holding midfield role against Chelsea . 4-1-4-1: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Blackett, Shaw; Rooney; Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Young; Falcao . United’s injury setback means that Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao could both be recalled against Jose Mourinho’s side. ‘I have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that’s not so good for us,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it’s not like that. Carrick is out and Rojo is out, but also Blind and Jones. ‘That’s the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Evans is suspended so we don’t have many choices. Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don’t have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow. ‘Other players can take profit of the momentum now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team. ‘You have seen that I took Jones off pitch (against Manchester City) because of injury, you have seen that Carrick was off the pitch, you have seen the tackle of Kompany against Blind. Only Rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match. ‘It’s because of the distance between the matches. Blind and Jones were very close to playing but it was not enough. ‘Other players can take profit of the moment now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team.’ Louis van Gaal addresses the media ahead of Man United's crucial Premier League clash with Chelsea . Luke Shaw hasn't featured under Louis van Gaal recently but should return to play at left back . Juan Mata is closed down by his Man United team-mates during a training session on Friday . Maroaune Fellaini will be hoping to continue his impressive form against Chelsea on Saturday evening . Marouane Fellaini is embraced by his team-mates after scoring against rivals Man City last week . Sports analysts BSports predict that a Chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at Stamford Bridge . Asked if Shaw could return for the first time since being substituted in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal last month amid concerns over his fitness, Van Gaal replied: ‘Maybe you shall see tomorrow. You never know. Luke is fit enough I think. He has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don’t like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough.’ With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over third-placed United, Van Gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title. He also claimed that Mourinho will be happy with a draw. ‘It’s still possible, I’ve said that before,’ he added. ‘It is not logical but it is possible. It’s more when and if, and I don’t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. ‘But, alright, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea’s shoulders. You never know, you’ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons. So I cannot say it is not possible, but it is not logical. ‘They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw. Of course they will want to beat Manchester United and we want to beat them, the question is how long players can play in the discipline. ‘We live for these titles, we are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it. That’s why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. ‘To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is also a goal of mine. That is why I’m still a manager because I don’t have to work anymore – you can count on that. I like to work with young people and help them in their career.’ Robin van Persie (back right) has only been training with United for a week but may return to feature . Van Gaal gave a young Mourinho his break in coaching at Barcelona. Asked to compare the Portuguese with his current assistant Ryan Giggs, the United boss admitted that he has been surprised by the Old Trafford legend’s work ethic. He said: ‘It’s always difficult. People compare with each other because Jose Mourinho was not the world-class player that Ryan Giggs was. So that’s the same thing with me. I was not as world-class as, for example, Johann Cruyff yet our ambition is maybe then higher. ‘But I have to admit that I could not imagine when I spoke with him (Giggs) in May or June to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it, that he works very hard. As an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker, and he reads the game very well like Jose. But to manage a group you have to work, and what I can see is that he’s learning quickly.’ Chris Smalling celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at Old Trafford .","Manchester United have won six games in a row ahead of Chelsea clash .

2834,"Police in California have released surveillance images of a man who robbed a bank dressed in women's clothing - leading investigators to compare his outfit with Mrs Doubtfire. The eccentrically-disguised man entered a branch of the U.S Bank in the city of Santa Cruz at around 3pm last Friday and handed the cashier a note demanding money. His blonde wig, female clothing, glasses and purse immediately prompted comparisons with Mrs Doubtfire from the 1993 movie of the same name in which Robin Williams played a divorcee who dresses as an elderly female nanny to spend more time with his children. Cross-dresser: The eccentrically-disguised man entered a branch of the U.S Bank in the city of Santa Cruz at around 3pm last Friday and handed the cashier a note demanding money . Santa Cruz Police Department released the surveillance images yesterday as they stepped up their efforts to find the cross-dressing bankrobber. The 25 to 35-year-old man made off with an unknown sum of money after the U.S. Bank employee responded to his demand without raising the alarm. No weapon was used or mentioned during the robber and nobody was injured, according to the San Jose Mercury. Authorities searched the area around the bank shortly afterwards, but he was not found. Lieutenant Bernie Escalante said a man wearing exactly the same outfit had been seen 'acting suspiciously' outside a nearby Rabobank roughly an hour before the U.S. Bank robbery. Rabobank staff went out to speak to the man and he left the area without incident, Escalante said. Uncanny: The bankrobber's blonde wig, female clothing and spectacles prompted comparisons with Mrs Doubtfire from the 1993 movie of the same name starring the late Robin Williams . Santa Cruz police said the man appeared to be aged between 25 and 35, was about five foot five inches tall and weighed 160-170 pounds. He was described as having dark skin and wore prescription glasses and a wavy blonde wig. His outfit was listed as navy blue hospital scrubs with a light-purple long-sleeved shirt underneath. 'We believe these are great photos of the suspect, and somebody in the community has to recognize this person,' Lt Escalante said as he urged anyone with information to contact his officers. Mrs Doubtfire was released in 1993 to mixed reviews from critics but was a massive box office hit - only falling behind Jurassic Park as the highest-grossing film of the year. Work on a sequel began in 2001 but was scrapped five years later after Williams declared the script 'useless'. Production resumed in April 2014, but all plans for the sequel were scrapped once and for all with Williams' suicide four months later.","Cross-dressing bankrobber entered U.S. Bank in Santa Cruz on Friday .

5735,"Former Holland forward Dirk Kuyt is returning to Feyenoord next season, aiming to end his professional playing days at the club that was a launching pad for nine years at Liverpool and Fenerbahce, the Rotterdam club announced Friday. Kuyt signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord, who are currently third in the top-flight Eredivisie, but said his stay will likely be longer. Kuyt grew into a favorite among Feyenoord's fanatical fans during his first stint with the club from 2003-2006, after transferring from Utrecht. He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in the 2004-2005 season and was named Dutch footballer of the year in 2006. Dirk Kuyt (left) is returning to Feyenoord, nine years after leaving the Dutch Eredivsie club for Liverpool . Kuyt retired from international football in October after finishing third with the Netherlands at last year's World Cup - a tournament where he underscored his versatility by playing on the wing and at left back. He made 104 appearances for the Netherlands and scored 24 goals. He also was part of the team that finished second in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, losing to Spain in the final. The 34-year-old said now is a good time to return to Rotterdam as ""I'm fit and have a great drive to make a success of my time at De Kuip,"" Feyenoord's stadium. Feyenoord director Martin van Geel said that although Kuyt signed only a one-year deal both he and the club intend his stay in Rotterdam to be longer. ""Dirk can keep going for years,"" Van Geel said. ""As far as he's concerned, he can become the Ryan Giggs of Feyenoord and we will add many more years. This will be music to the ears of all Feyenoord fans."" The forward has had a successful career for Liverpool, Fenerbache and playing for his country .","Dirk Kuyt agrees one-year-deal to move back to former club Feyenoord .

5502,"The ultimate supercar sales pitch? Can I sell you a car for your wife as well as your girlfriend? It may sound more like the kind of line once uttered by used-car salesman Arthur Daley but such is the wealth of a new breed of rich who are buying up Ferraris, Lamborghinis  and Porsches, that it's not an unfeasible question. A new Channel 4 series shines a light on the UK's billion-pound supercar industry, where some of the best salespeople can turn over millions of pounds of profit every year. Scroll down for video . A woman in a man's world: Expert seller Saba Syed, pictured above with husband Sheikh Amari, sells luxury cars to the super rich. Saba says more and more women are coming into the showroom . Happy to break the mould: Saba doesn't flinch in the traditionally male-dominated world of motoring and says: 'Women have very good taste in cars.' While mere mortals might only dream of getting behind the wheel of some of these ultimate driving machines, a select portion of the world's population are trading them like toys. A standard supercar can cost around £250,000, with the exterior paint alone costing up to £10,000, while some of the industry's more sought-after vehicles can expect to sell for millions at London's prestigious car auctions. The supercar business is unashamedly male-dominated - these are the original boys toys, after all. Yet one woman is breaking the mould, with a little help from her car-loving husband. Preston-based Saba Syed and husband Sheikh Amari have been married for 12 years and run one of the country's leading supercar dealerships exporting dream cars across the globe. While Sheikh buys the cars, Saba does the selling and isn't afraid to be a woman in a man's world. In fact, she thinks her gender helps her sell more cars. Driving down a different path: Tom Hartley left school at 11 to focus on 'wheeling and dealing'...his son Carl has followed the same path, ditching education in favour of a role in his dad's business . In Supercars: The Million Pound Motors, airing tonight, she says: 'It just feels great to be that one person who's not the stereotype.' She insists her dealership goes the extra mile to ensure cars are extremely clean: 'Our prep is quite in-depth and we clean in places where most dealers wouldn't. That's a woman's touch.' Her husband admits he's addicted to cars: 'If you cut me open you've got super unleaded fuel coming out of me.' He describes the classic cars that he sells as 'works of art'. Saba says that she can tell straight away what a customer wants: 'My focus is on the lifestyle choice. I firmly believe that anyone who comes in knows whether they want to buy or not. 'You live once, you work hard. They're buying into a lifestyle of luxury.' Although the premium car market might traditionally be seen as something that men enjoy more, Saba says more and more women are coming into the showroom. 'Women have very good taste in cars. You don't honestly think we talk about cars do you [when selling]. We talk about shiny, red soles!' Another leading UK supercar salesman is self-made millionaire Tom Hartley, 53, who runs his motoring business with son Carl. Tom sells to everyone from actors to music industry stars and even has a helipad next to his showroom to ensure would-be buyers can zoom in and out from the skies if they need to . Hartley left school at 11 to concentrate on honing his wheeler-dealer skills and now turns over millions of pounds every year. His biggest sale to date is a car that fetched £40million. His son Carl followed an almost identical route, leaving education at 11 to join the established business. The pair, who live in seven-bedroom luxury mansions opposite each other in Derbyshire have their spectacular showroom inbetween their properties. The father-and-son duo sell to everyone from celebrities to footballers and music industry people to actors and shift around £4million worth of luxury cars every week. Carl says of his deal-maker Dad: 'He's my role model, everything I know, I know because I've learned from him.' Owner Tom has been warned to take a backseat in the business due to health problems caused by his full-on lifestyle, a task that he's not found easy: . 'Slow down? I don't think I will. I love challenges. I love adventure. I love gambling and I love taking a risk.' In matte black, please: The world's wealthy are lusting after the Lamborghini Aventador . Top speed: 217mph (350km/h) Acceleration: 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 2.9s . Fuel tank capacity: 90 litres (23.8 gal.) Engine oil capacity: 13 litres (3.4 gal.) Distribution: Only 200 units were made . If you have around £300,000 to spend on a flash car, then the Lamborghini Aventador is the car of the moment. Footballers love them as do the young, rich Arabs who flock to London during the summer months. UK supercar dealer Tom Hartley says the car is the 'leading in-demand, super-rich car to buy.' The Aventador retails at around £300,000 and boasts an incredible set of specs, managing 0-62mph in 2.9 seconds and reaching a top speed of 217mph. Earlier this year, boxer Amir Khan posted a shot on Instagram of his Aventador. Other celebrities who own one of the vehicles include the Kardashians and Justin Bieber. Last month, Premier League striker Steven Fletcher was widely ridiculed after he took delivery of the supercar, with fans quick to point out that his performance on the pitch didn't merit such extravagance. Dozens of fans shared a mock message on Twitter reading: ‘Steven Fletcher: two seasons, seven goals, one new Lamborghini Aventador.’","Saba and Sheikh Amari run luxury car dealership in Preston .

1982,"There were no apologies from Floyd Mayweather for claiming to be greater than Muhammad Ali. There was reverence for God, even though Manny Pacquiao believes the Almighty is in his corner. There was an emotional remembrance of the frail old gentleman back in his tough birth-place of Grand Rapids, Michigan who was his surrogate grandfather. Floyd Mayweather is preparing to face Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand on May 2 in Las Vegas . Mayweather has defended his announcement that he feels he is The Best Ever ahead of the mega-fight . Mayweather built a reputation on being brash and flash but was soft-spoken during his conference call . There was sympathy for Freddie Roach in his battle with Parkinson's disease' even though Pacquiao's trainer has been trash-talking his claim to be The Best Ever. There were even soft-spoken words of thanks for we 200 hacks on the conference call for helping sell the half-billion-dollar richest fight of all time. Goodbye to the brash, flash, bombastic Floyd Jnr. Well, more or less. Hello to the mature Mr Mayweather who weighs his words carefully and respects one and all. Well, mostly. He has been slammed for pronouncing himself superior to Ali so he said: 'I respect all the great champions of the past. But I've done just as much as Ali did. 'He was champion at heavyweight but I've won world titles in five divisions. He fought for a helluva cause (anti-Vietnam War) but I'm still sharp at age 38. Still going strong at age 38. 'He lost, once to man who'd only had seven fights previously. I'm undefeated. He called himself The Greatest so I call myself The Best Ever. I knew there would be a back-lash but I couldn't care less. 'He said he was greater than Sugar Ray Robinson and someone else will come along in the future to be criticised for believing he's the best.' The God question did not faze him: 'I also believe in God. I've been blessed in my life. I love God and I don't believe God takes sides (in fights). We are all God's children and I don't think he roots for which of us he wants to win.' Geroge Foreman is down on count two after being struck by Muhammad Ali's killer right-hander in 1974 . Ali looks on after he knocked Foreman to the canvas with the holy mother of all right-handers during the bout . Ali called himself The Greatest and the Rumble in the Jungle was voted the best sporting event of the century . Roach has characterised the fight as 'good against evil' but the barbs have not rattled Mayweather: 'I'm not going to say anything negative about Freddie Roach. Not against someone who's not 100 per cent healthy. He's entitled to say what he wants to say. It's better for me to say nothing at all. 'His fighter is not talking like that and it's only me and Pacquiao who will do the fighting. I wish Freddie well.' The new, considerate Floyd choked up a little when asked about important influences who had inspired him to greatness. He took us back to Grand Rapids and a certain Mr Frank Brown, saying: 'He was important to me from the age of three, Like a grandfather. He would drive me to fights in my amateur days (no Money back then). Sometimes hundreds of miles. He believed in me more than anyone. He told me I'd make it. He took me to church. 'He came to so many of my fights right up to Oscar De La Hoya. But he's not doing well now. He's in an old folks home. He's losing his memory. It hurts. I love the guy so much. I think about him every day.' It went quiet for a moment on the line. It seemed like a good time to ask why he had changed from cocksure to contemplative almost to the point of silence. Mayweather slips a punch from Oscar De La Hoya in the eighth round at the MGM Grand on May 5, 2007 . Mayweather poses with the WBC super welterweight belt after beating De La Hoya by split decision in 2007 . 'I had to be loud to get where we are today,' he said. 'At 17 or 18 I was saying look at me. The big personality was part of that game plan. To get to this point we're at now. Making seven figures in one night. Now I'm here. And as you get older you mature.' And he welcomes the challenge which some think threatens his unbeaten legacy: 'I respect Manny Pacquaio. To be here now he must be doing something right. 'We reached the point where this fight had to happen. He's one of the last great fighters of our time left for me to defeat. I'm glad it's happening.' He goes back again to a moment in his youth: 'When I was 17 or 18 Mike Tyson had come out of prison. I went to the MGM to watch him fight. Busy? I thought, man, we'll never see the MGM Grand this packed ever again. Manny Pacquiao says he will have to be a warrior against Mayweather but is convinced he will win . Pacquiao works out at a park in Los Angeles, California, ahead of his $300million mega-fight on May 2 . Pacquiao is joined by supporters during training as he jogs along a city street to a park in Los Angeles . 'But then I started to believe I could do record numbers one day and now me and my team are making it happen.' Two days earlier Pacquiao had time for only two words at his conference call before his promoter Bob Arum hung up the phone in frustration at some questions he deemed banal. Mayweather gave us about half-an-hour of insights which, at the end, came down to these six words of blinding simplicity: 'My game plan is to win.'","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao meet on May 2 in Las Vegas .

2713,"When Jade and Ross Morley were told that their first baby, Floyd-Henry, had a rare form of dwarfism called Achondroplasia, they made the decision that their son would be celebrated instead of pitied. The Morleys, from Casuarina on the north coast of NSW, released a video to explain Floyd's condition to their friends and family, in a bid to make their community a kinder place for their 'little legend'. Less than two years later, Floyd is now a big brother to three-week-old twins, and his mum Jade said that she knows the two newest additions to their family will be his biggest supporters. Scroll down for video . Jade and Ross Morley have welcomed twins into their family, making their son Floyd-Henry, who has Achondroplasia dwarfism, a big brother . Harrison Stone Morley and Cleo Téa Morley were born at 37 weeks on March 20, meaning the Morley household now has three children under 20 months- a fact which Jade said is 'crazy'. 'It was pretty unexpected. We were utterly shocked when we found out we were having twins,' Jade told Daily Mail Australia. The twins were born on March 20 this year . The Morley's aren't strangers to unexpected news, finding out when Floyd was only five months old that he had a rare genetic condition which meant he didn't grow as quickly as other kids. 'When we had Floyd we thought he was just a normal, happy baby. At about four months we noticed that he had really chubby arms and legs and knew something wasn't right,' Jade said. 'Even when our pediatrician ordered x-rays, we still didn't think anything was wrong. But when they came back with his notes on them, mentioning characteristics like short legs and low muscle tone, I Googled them and dwarfism just jumped out at me from every page,' she said. 'The day the pediatrician called to tell us Floyd had Achondroplasia was the day that changed it all.' Jade said that she and her husband Ross were 'utterly devastated' by the diagnosis, especially because the only information she could find about Achondroplasia was quite negative. 'We couldn't find anything that told us that we would be fine, that this wasn't a death sentence and that we wouldn't be going through big surgeries,' she said. While the couple were still grappling with the news, they decided to tell a few of their close friends about Floyd's Achondroplasia. The Morley household now has three children under 20 months- a fact which Jade said is 'crazy' 'It was pretty unexpected. We were utterly shocked when we found out we were having twins,' Jade said . Harrison Stone Morley and Cleo Téa Morley were born at 37 weeks . The twins are healthy and feeding well and are much loved by their big brother Floyd . 'When we told one of our friends, she gasped, she couldn't believe it.  I decided from that day I was going to educate my friends and family because I didn’t want them to be sorry for Floyd, we wanted to celebrate him and have them be happy for us,' Jade said. 'I said to my husband that it would be a nice idea do a celebratory video about Floyd and his diagnosis. I wanted to show that even though he would be a bit different that was it, I wanted to stop stares of the community because everyone would know him,' she said. The video was posted to Facebook and which explained how Jade and Ross met, fell in love, married, and had a 'beautiful baby boy'. The clip explains that Floyd-Henry was diagnosed with Achondroplasia, which means he will be 'a shorty- a little man, a little legend'. 'We were just going to send it out in an email to our friends and family, so it was pretty nervewracking just putting it out there. Some of our best friends didn't even know about Floyd and we just threw it up on the internet,' Jade said. The video quickly went viral, and was shared and liked around the world, as well as used by dwarfism awareness websites as inspirational. 'The response was beautiful, no one said they were sorry, everyone said 'how wonderful', which is exactly what he is,' Jade said. 'What's beautiful is that it's really doing it's job and educating our local community, which was the most important thing for me,' she said. Jade and Ross posted a video to Facebook to explain Floyd's Achondroplasia .

Every day in the street someone will come up to me and say 'This is Floyd', and they know who he is and we don’t have to explain that he is different.' Floyd is now a happy, healthy 20-month-old, who is very excited about having two new playmates around. 'He loves the twins, he's fascinated with them. Every morning when he wakes up he says 'mumma' and then points to the cot where the twins are sleeping,' Jade said. 'Floyd tries to talk to the 'bubbas' and pats them on the head. He's such a kind little boy which is all I care about,' she said. The twins don't carry the gene mutation that caused Floyd's mutation, and weren't genetically disposed as Floyd's condition was caused by a random rather than inherited syndrome. 'It happens in one in 40,000 babies, so they had just as much chance as getting it as anyone. We never even thought about it with them, and though we had scans right up until the birth because they were twins, we never even thought about testing them,' Jade said. Jade said that she and Ross are looking forward to their three kids being best friends, and to them loving each other well. 'I just hope they love each other and support each other. It's how I grew up, my brother and sisters are everything to me and I want that for my children,' she said. Floyd is now a happy, healthy 20-month-old, who is very excited about having two new playmates around . Achondroplasia affects one in every 40,000 babies and is nomally a random genetic mutation . 'Cleo and Harry will be Floyd's biggest supporters, beside me and Ross.' 'Floyd is such a little dude, he is so cheeky and has the most beautiful soul. He is so funny and loves a bit of attention. We just can't get over his cuteness, he just stomps all over the house.' Jade said that Floyd is an intelligent little boy who has a big future ahead of him. 'Most of his demands come from his complications. He has low muscle tone which means he doesn't have as much ability as other kids,' she said. 'In two weeks he's having an operation to put in his gromits [hearing aids] which we're looking forward to because at the moment it would just sound to him like he's underwater.' The Morley's, who said they aren't very different from many other parents, are passionate about raising the profile of Achondroplasia in Australia. They use their tag line 'he's small, that's all' in their approach to life with Floyd, and are active in connecting with other parents with children who have differences. 'There are so many parents out there that are going through a similar experience, and I think that's why people relate to us,' Jade said. 'When you have a child that's a little different, you enter a world of really accepting and understanding parents,' she said. Jade said that she and Ross are looking forward to their three kids being best friends . Jade said that she knows the two newest additions to their family will be his biggest supporters . We were utterly shocked when we found out we were having twins,' Jade said . Jade said that she feels that both she and Ross are better people because of their experience, and that they both 'just want to meet people who are different' all the more. 'We didn't know anything about Floyd's condition when he was diagnosed and I remember thinking that people aren't treating those with it very well,' she said. 'I remember very clearly one night deciding that if this is what he has, I was going to educate the entire world. His world is going to be a kind world and the only way that is going to happen is if we get something out there.' Jade said that what she is most passionate about is encouraging children who are curious about Floyd to come over and ask about his Achondroplasia. 'I would prefer a kid who is staring to be encouraged by their parents to come over and ask 'how come he is littler?' than just stare and have their parent tell them to stop looking, or shush them,' she said. 'I want to spark conversations and have kids talk about it. Then I can tell them that Floyd is just like you or me but small.'","Jade and Ross Morley released a video to explain to their friends and family that their first child Floyd-Henry had Achondroplasia dwarfism .

9579,"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)More than 4,600 people dead. More than 9,000 injured. Eight million affected across Nepal. One million children urgently in need of help. Those are the startling numbers that indicate the scale of the devastation from the huge earthquake that struck the Himalayan nation on Saturday. And some of the grim figures are likely to get even worse as hopes of rescuing any more survivors diminish every hour. Heartbreaking scenes of suffering and loss are playing out across this shell-shocked nation as it reels from its deadliest natural disaster in more than 80 years. As the country coped with the fallout of the quake, another natural disaster struck Tuesday afternoon in a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu, and up to 200 people were feared missing as a result of a landslide, a trekking association official said. It happened around 4 p.m. in Langtang National Park, said Ramesh Dhamala, president of the Trekking Agents of Nepal. Laxmi Dhakal, spokesman for Nepal's Home Ministry, said  he was aware of reports about the landslide but wasn't immediately able to confirm details. Quake relief efforts continued Tuesday, but officials warned that they were hampered by problems of getting aid into the country and then delivering it to some of the remote communities in desperate need. In Kathmandu, a capital city of shattered temples and toppled houses, some people paid their last respects to loved ones taken by the quake. By the Bagmati River, which winds through the city, more than a dozen funeral pyres burned Monday. As workers stoked the flames for the Hindu cremation ceremonies, some mourners shaved their heads in a traditional show of mourning from children who lose their parents. Alongside their father, two teenage brothers from the Gurung family, Ishan and Iman, said goodbye to their mother, Ishara. ""We never imagined this would happen to us. This much pain,"" said Ishan, the elder of the two. Elsewhere in the city, many shaken residents are sleeping in the open. Some have lost their homes, others are afraid to stay in buildings that may be vulnerable to aftershocks. Large encampments of tents have sprung up in open areas, including a wide space belonging to the military in the center of the city that is typically used for parades. One of the grand gates to the field is now just a pile of rubble. Kisnor Raj Giri, a 22-year-old man from Kathmandu who lost members of his extended family in the quake, said he was too scared to return home. He is camping out at the military grounds with thousands of others even though frequent rain has made the nights an ordeal. ""Many people are crying, sharing their hardships,"" he told CNN on Monday evening. The elements showed no mercy to the homeless masses on Tuesday as thunderstorms rumbled over Kathmandu. More bad weather is forecast for the region in the coming days. But in one piece of good news, Turkish and Chinese rescue crews helped pull free a 21-year-old man trapped under rubble near a city bus park in a 13-hour rescue operation. Houses and families ripped apart by earthquake . The death toll has now climbed above 4,600 in Nepal, officials said Tuesday evening, as rescue and relief efforts continue. Nepal army Lt. Col. A. J. Thapa told CNN's Sumnima Udas that the first 72 hours after the earthquake is the time when the most lives can be saved. ""This is not the time to rest and lament,"" he said. ""This is the time to go out and save lives."" Thapa said an entire military post was lost during an avalanche. ""Remember we are not an outside force that has been parachuted into an area to help,"" he said. ""We are victim ourselves. ... Despite the fact that soldiers have their families and houses are down, we are trying to build morale, maintain morale and help themselves."" Thapa said it was fortunate that the quake struck during daylight on a weekend. ""Children were not trapped in big schools somewhere and lot of people were outside because it was daytime,"" he said. Dhakal, the Home Ministry spokesman, put the death toll at 4,620, while Nepal's National Emergency Coordination Center said the number of dead was 4,727. Both sources gave the number of people injured as 9,239. Another 72 people died in India, while China reported 25 deaths. Most of the casualty numbers in Nepal are believed to have come mainly from Kathmandu and the surrounding area. They are expected to climb as information emerges from remote areas. ""We have incomplete information, but we apprehend the death toll will go up,"" Nepalese Information Minister Minendra Rijal told CNN earlier on Tuesday. ""We cannot say by how much exactly."" The news agency Reuters cited Prime Minister Sushil Koirala as saying that the toll could reach 10,000 and that the country was ""on a war footing"" in its rescue and relief work. In a live, televised address to the nation, the Prime Minister said the country had been stunned by the disaster and announced three days of national mourning, starting Tuesday. The government's first priority is to continue search and rescue operations and relief efforts, he said, as he thanked all those involved. Historic and religious monuments destroyed by the earthquake will be reconstructed in time, he added. At least 90% of 96,000 Nepali army troops have been deployed in relief and rescue operations, according to Nepal army spokesman Jagadish Chandra Pokharel. More than 15 countries and agencies have already promised help, Koirala said, as he appealed for other nations also to come to Nepal's aid. Even as international aid pours into the country, overwhelmed hospitals are lacking vital medical supplies, people remain buried in the wreckage of buildings and rescuers are struggling to reach hard-hit rural areas near the quake's epicenter. ""The biggest problem is reaching these villages,"" Matt Darvas, an emergency communications officer for the humanitarian group World Vision, told CNN from Gorkha district, northwest of Kathmandu. Nepal struggles to cope with international aid . Nepali Home Ministry Joint Secretary Sagar Mani Parajuli, who is coordinating relief efforts, said government efforts to get aid to remote areas had been hampered by rugged terrain and poor weather, which limits the use of helicopters. ""The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain, we cannot use surface transport much but are using it,"" he said. ""We need 150,000 tents and tarpaulins, but we don't have enough of them."" Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. resident coordinator for Nepal, told a news conference Tuesday that bringing in relief materials has been difficult because Kathmandu's international airport, which has just one runway and space for only a limited number of aircraft to park, is log jammed. The United Nations is aware of the request for tents, he said, but is working to procure high quality ones to withstand the expected monsoon rains. Of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of Nepal, some 1.4 million need food aid, McGoldrick added. Nepal's population is about 31 million. At an event in Paris, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his condolences to the people of Nepal and called the humanitarian needs ""huge and urgent."" ""The United Nations is supporting international operations for search and rescue and strengthening relief efforts,"" he said. ""I count on the generosity of the international community in Nepal's hour of need and the longer term rebuilding efforts that will be needed."" A CNN team that joined a Nepalese military helicopter flight to Dhulikhel, a rural area east of Kathmandu, saw extensive damage in the Kathmandu Valley from the air, including many landslides. On landing, the team went to a hospital where all the injured from six surrounding districts are being brought. More than 1,000 people are currently in the hospital -- three times its usual capacity -- so some of the injured are being left out in the streets. Social media posts from Nepal . Darvas of World Vision said he had been told of frightening levels of damage in villages in the region surrounding Gorkha district, which is near the earthquake's epicenter. They included one where 35 out of 45 homes were destroyed and another where 70% of the houses had collapsed, trapping and crushing the people inside, most of them children and the elderly. Even though aid groups and Nepalese officials are aware of critical situations in areas spread across Nepal's mountainous terrain, they face daunting challenges getting help to them. ""Some of those villages -- several years ago, before there was vehicle transport -- used to take seven days to reach. Roads are shut now to some of those villages, so we can only imagine how long it will take to get there,"" Darvas said Monday. He said injured people who had been airlifted from some remote areas were often suffering from crush injuries, lacerations and dislocations. Looking for missing loved ones in Nepal? CNN iReport wants to help . UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, said Sunday that nearly 1 million Nepalese children urgently need assistance. Aid groups and at least 16 nations rushed aid and workers to Nepal, with more on the way. High-altitude rescue efforts have also been undertaken on the difficult terrain of Mount Everest, where the earthquake released deadly avalanches. Four U.S. citizens are among those who died on Everest, according to officials and relatives. Damage to climbing infrastructure on the mountain, not to mention the overall situation in Nepal, means the climbing season is over for the year, climber Jim Davidson told CNN from the Everest base camp, where he was evacuated after spending two days on the mountain.

1086,"These shocking pictures show a young bear being chained to a tree and attacked by dogs as part of a baiting competition to hone hunting skills in Yakutsk, eastern Russia. The controversial contest, held in the forests of the diamond-rich Sakha Republic, is celebrated in the region as a way of recognising the best canine bear hunter. Attacks by brown bears on humans are a danger in many parts of Russia, particularly at this time of the year as they awake hungry following the long winter hibernation. Brutal game: The picture shows a young bear chained to a tree while several dogs undergo 'hunting training' with the predator . Under attack: Masha, a five-year-old bear, can be seen attacked by a number of dogs as she is chained to the tree by her neck . Tradition: Once the dogs have found their way to Masha, they have to bark as loudly as they can with their cajoling scored out of 100 points . Many have to be killed when they encroach into built-up areas looking for food, often with dogs trained to stalk them in order for hunters to shoot them. But the images of the five-year-old chained up bear being attacked and bitten are likely to anger animal rights and anti-hunting groups in the West. In Russia, hunting of many kinds is a respected and mainstream activity and such contests as shown on these pictures raise few eyebrows. The pictures were taken by photo-journalist Spiridon Sleptsov during a visit to the Bayanay Hunting Club, near Yakutsk, where he captured competitors taking part in the 6th Republican contest to find the best individual hunting dog, and the best pairing of dogs, reported The Siberian Times. The 'sporting event' sees the dogs released about 100 metres(330ft) away from the bear, and they have to rely on scents and traces of the animal to find it within two minutes. Once they have found their target chained to the tree, the dogs have to bark as loudly, and as menacingly, as they can with their cajoling scored out of 100 points. The more fearsome the harassment, and the greater the number of bites on the bear, the higher the score for the dog. Face to face: Masha the bear growls at one of the dogs she faces during the cruel 'hunting competition' near Yakutsk, eastern Russia . Dog training: The 'sporting event' sees the dogs released some 330ft away from Masha and they have to rely on scents and traces of the bear to find it within two minutes . Having fun?: The dog owners said Masha has been used in the 'hunting contests' for a number of years, even claiming she enjoys them and has grown to understand the dogs . The pictures were taken by photo-journalist Spiridon Sleptsov during a visit to the Bayanay Hunting Club, near Yakutsk, . Mr Sleptsov said: 'Ideally after bursting into a loud bark the dog must attack the beast from behind, constantly twisting it around, thereby keeping the bear in one place and giving the hunter an idea of where to go. 'Rating the work in pairs took into account the coherence and mutual assistance between them. 'If only one of the dogs attacked the bear actively, the score was reduced and if the second dog did not pay attention to bear at all, the pair was disqualified.' The dogs also have to show how well they can stop a bear from running away, replicating what would happen in the wild if they were waiting for a hunter to come and kill it. The photographer added: 'It was rather hard to calm the over-heated dogs. 'Seeing that their owner was approaching, the dog began to bark at the beast with renewed energy and it took a lot of effort to pull them back from the bear.' Cruel: The dogs' owners stand ready to leash their animals after they have had their go at 'hunting' Masha . Just within reach: The young bear reaches out in an attempt to get hold of a white dog . All over? Masha the bear appears to have decided to take a time out from the fighting, seemingly lying down on her back . Unusually warm weather across Russia has prompted bears to awake from hibernation early with warnings that they could attack people as they forage for food. A number of sightings of the animals has been made in parts of Siberia and the Far East in recent weeks, much earlier than normal. In the southern Siberian region of Tuva - where about 3,500 bears live - two men were savagely attacked, suffering serious head and arm injuries, with one of them losing an eye. It is thought that the dogs taking part in the competition in Yakutsk were not experienced hunting animals but were instead only there for 'sporting purposes'. The bear, called Masha, has been used in the contests for a number of years with claims she enjoys them and has grown to understand the dogs. Mr Sleptsov said: 'To aggressive dogs capable of painful bite, Masha's attitude was different. 'Despite her apparent slowness, her attacks, like any wild animal, were extremely sharp and unexpected. 'To be fair, it should be noted that in all the years of holding such events, no dog has been injured by her paws and teeth.'","Bear seen chained to a tree for baiting competition to hone dogs' hunting skills in eastern Russia .

2745,"Alexis Sanchez is developing a fondness for Wembley Stadium. Two goals for Chile against England were followed by two goals in the FA Cup semi-final against Reading. It is a stage that suits him and Arsenal will expect even more when they return for the FA Cup final next month. ‘Let us hope he keeps that up and scores twice in the final,’ said Santi Cazorla. ‘We are happy for him. He is a key player for us, in a good moment.’ Alexis Sanchez celebrates as his goals take Arsenal into the 2015 FA Cup Final . The Gunners forward wheels away after opening the scoring in the 2-1 defeat of Reading on Saturday . Sanchez slides to his knees as he keeps his impressive scoring record at Wembley going . After an explosive start to his first season in England, including a burst of 14 goals in 18 games, Sanchez has emerged from a more subdued mid-season with three strikes in his last three matches. The extra-time winner on Saturday, however, owed almost everything to a dreadful goalkeeping error by Adam Federici. Sanchez is shortlisted for the PFA Player of the Year with Chelsea’s Eden Hazard the hot favourite, but it may be the most impressive debut campaign from an overseas signing since Gianfranco Zola. Like Zola, who arrived at Chelsea in 1996-97, Sanchez can end his first season with an FA Cup win and Arsene Wenger will stress the marginal gains if Arsenal can claim second in the Barclays Premier League for the first time in a decade. The Chile international struck his second goal to save Arsenal in extra-time . Arsenal team-mates congratulate Sanchez as they head into a second successive FA Cup Final . Sanchez's second goal owed a lot to a mistake by Reading keeper Adam Federici . If so, the Chilean signed for £32million from Barcelona last summer has been largely responsible. He has been fabulous to watch, loyal to the traditions of Wenger’s flamboyant attacking style with bottomless reserves of energy and a contagious desire. He has 22 goals and there are signs of a good chemistry developing with Mesut Ozil since the German’s return from injury in January. They combined for the first at Wembley. Wenger has admitted for weeks that he would like to give Sanchez a breather but his influence has been so vital — and the race for Champions League places so tight — that the manager has found it difficult. And Sanchez just keeps going. His season started with 45 minutes in the FA Community Shield, his Arsenal debut, on August 10 and will stretch through to the Copa America in his home country. The 26-year-old also scored a brace at Wembley in Chile's 2-0 defeat of England in November 2013 . Sanchez celebrates his second goal against England before his move to the Premier League from Barcelona . He has played eight internationals since the World Cup, starting in seven, with six of them on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. ‘Of course, we are all tired and so is he,’ said Cazorla. ‘He has the Copa America, too, but he just wants to play all of the time. Now, we have to rest and finish the season with the objectives we had at the start.’ Sunday will be a test of Arsenal’s progress. Can they stall Chelsea’s title charge? Has Wenger made enough improvements to halt his terrible run of results against Jose Mourinho teams? ‘We have to show we are now on a consistent level and it is a good opportunity to do that next Sunday,’ said Wenger. ‘Let’s finish this season well. We have six games, a big game next weekend and I believe we have the spirit, which is encouraged by the results. ‘We have learned from our hiccups. We have matured a little bit. When we had a difficult moment against Reading the team kept going. We don’t feel sorry for ourselves. We just keep to our plan.’ Per Mertesacker was forced off with an ankle problem but most of Wenger’s injury worries are clearing. ‘The Cup final is better than any doctor,’ quipped the Arsenal boss. Arsene Wenger's side host league leaders Chelsea at the Emirates in their next match . Jack Wilshere (centre) was among the substitutes on Saturday as he continues his recovery . Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker was forced off the Wembley pitch with an ankle injury . Jack Wilshere was back in the squad, an unused substitute at Wembley after five months out, and Mathieu Debuchy played for the first time since dislocating his shoulder in January. In contrast to Sanchez, it has been a miserable first season at Arsenal for Debuchy, with operations on an ankle and a shoulder each ruling him out for three months. But the France defender is back and his next task will be a duel with Hazard. ‘I am so happy, it is so important to be back on the pitch with the team,’ said Debuchy. ‘It was hard for me after the second surgery but I am strong in my head. I need to work hard. I am not 100 per cent but I need to be ready.’","Arsenal defeated Reading 2-1 after extra-time to reach the FA Cup final .

And Beckenbauer believes the 47-year-old would be the perfect fit for Bayern when Guardiola, who has a contract until the summer of 2016, moves on. Franz Beckenbauer believes Jurgen Klopp could succeed Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich . Klopp has already announced that he will be leaving Borussia Dortmund in the summer . Klopp won two Bundesliga title in seven seasons with Borussia Dortmund despite being dubbed underdogs . Beckenbauer, who had two spells as manager at Bayern, told Sky: 'Of course I could imagine Klopp as Guardiola's successor. 'When I was president, we often talked about Klopp and believe he would fit very well at Bayern. 'Klopp is definitely an option at Bayern. The question is, how long Guardiola will be in Munich.

1468,"At last, some good news for Sunderland and Newcastle United — apparently form goes out of the window in a derby. Now isn’t that a relief? On Sunday afternoon, both sets of supporters will have the chance to suspend the depressing reality of their current plight. Over the course of their last six matches — 12 in total — the pair have amassed a not-so-mighty six points. During that same period — 18 hours of football, no less — they have scored four times between them, conceding 22 along the way. It is little wonder they have billed this one ‘The Desperation Derby’. Perhaps ‘The Donkey Derby’ would be more apt. John Carver issues instructions to his players during training on Friday ahead of Sunday's derby . Carver put his Newcastle players through their paces during the session at St James' Park . Dick Advocaat wraps up warm as he prepares his Sunderland side for Sunday's crunch clash . Sunderland are the country’s most out-of-form side and, unless new boss Dick Advocaat can reverse what is a sorry slide towards the bottom three, they will be back in the Championship come August. Newcastle won’t be, but therein lies the problem. It is job done on Tyneside. The Magpie mandate is survival and little more, a dispiriting acceptance of mediocrity which has permeated a squad in desperate need of overhaul, both in terms of quality and character. The same can be said of a Sunderland side who have won just four times all season. If it wasn’t for the history and intensity of the rivalry, this would have all the appeal of The Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion. Perhaps that is being disrespectful to pub teams, however. But, amid all of the gloom, the stakes remain sky high, albeit for different reasons. For Sunderland, it is about survival. Forget their bid for a record-making five straight victories over the enemy. Forget, even, bragging rights. Carver is fighting to secure his future as Newcastle manager beyond the end of this season . Advocaat was all smiles as he attempts to steer Sunderland clear of Premier League relegation . With trips to Arsenal and Chelsea to sign off their dismal season, this is one of six winnable matches which will determine their fate. Advocaat knows as much and hinted on Friday that he is working on a six-game rescue plan. Their last six have yielded just two points and one goal. Should that sad sequence persist then it will end in a future-defining demotion to the second tier. For never has relegation come at such a cost given the fulsome flow of the Premier League cash-cow. For Newcastle head coach John Carver, it’s about making a point. The outcome of this game will shape his future also. Lose, and the chances of him landing the job beyond the end of the season will take a serious hit. ‘I have stopped thinking about getting the job on a permanent basis, I really have, because if I keep worrying about everything that’s going on, if I keep worrying about everybody who has been linked with the job, then I won’t be giving this my 100 per cent, so I don’t even think about “permanent”,’ said Carver. ‘In my eyes, I am permanent. In the contract I signed there was nothing about “short term”, there was nothing about “interim”. I am the permanent manager and that’s my mindset on this, so I don’t even think about the summer.’ Newcastle are not in danger of relegation but their season has faded away in recent months . Jermain Defoe, who has scored twice since his return to England, trains with team-mates on Friday . Advocaat, meanwhile, will be gone come June, regardless of which division he leaves Sunderland in. To that end, his reputation is on the line. ‘If I didn’t think I could do it then I would have said “no”,’ said the 67-year-old, who has never been relegated, as a player or manager. ‘I need to give the players confidence. I need to be a little bit softer because of the position we’re in, but if they don’t do what I want then they won’t play. ‘The game against Aston Villa [4-0 home defeat] shows you that something is wrong. They will not play like that under me.’ History is at least on Advocaat’s side. By a quirk of footballing fate, his predecessors — Paolo di Canio and Gus Poyet — both won derbies in their second match in charge. ‘The pressure is on then, yes?’ laughed Advocaat. He may joke and dismiss such coincidence, but those victories both played a part in Sunderland avoiding relegation.

Tim Krul works on his handling as he prepares to keep Sunderland out in the Tyne-Weir derby on Sunday . And that is a recurring theme on Wearside — a tedious tale of an annual battle against the drop. At least that, however, offers some perverse excitement for supporters. Up the road at Newcastle, the club who returned profits of £18.7million last week are in debt to a fanbase which, mystifyingly, still exceeds 50,000 on a fortnightly basis. Anger has made way for apathy at Gallowgate, for fans have accepted that, as long as Mike Ashley remains in power, their lucrative existence — at least that is for the owner — resides somewhere between 17th and 10th. For the Toon Army, it is ‘The Derby of Disillusion’. Indeed, many supporters resent their own club as much as they do their rivals across the river. Throw in Jack Colback returning to the Stadium of Light for the first time since his defection to Newcastle, Sunderland’s Adam Johnson playing at home for the first time since his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl, as well as a ludicrous 4pm kick-off in the middle of a Bank Holiday weekend, and you feel that a potentially poisonous atmosphere awaits. But the good news is that form goes out of the window. We can only hope that much is true.","Newcastle travel to the Stadium of Light to face Sunderland  on Sunday .

Obama loosened the trade embargo early this year with a series of executive actions that allow easier U.S. travel to Cuba, more remittances to the island and, at least on paper, U.S. exports to support the island's relatively new private business sector. Obama also moved to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror, removing a barrier to access to the global financial system. Cuban officials have been pushing Obama to go further with measures that could include more specific federal licenses for U.S. businesses to trade with Cuba in ways currently prohibited. 'The president of the United States has the ability to grant licenses to businesses so that businesses can actually start developing right now in select areas and those are areas that we want to pursue,' Cuomo said.

4581,"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)The questions Turks asked on Tuesday were tinged with fear. ""What's going on? What happened? Why can't I get into the subway?"" asked an elderly woman in a white headscarf with several shopping bags as she stood outside the barricaded entrance to one of Istanbul's busiest subway stations. She was one of millions of Turks left confused and concerned by the worst power outage to grip the country in more than a decade. Dozens of cities across Turkey lost power for hours on Tuesday. Millions of people were affected, including passengers stranded on paralyzed trains and subways. Municipal workers were forced to evacuate Istanbul's Marmaray Tunnel, where the black-out left commuters trapped deep beneath the rushing waters of the Bosphorus Strait. More than 24 hours later, Turkish officials were still at pains to explain the power outage. The energy minister suggested a possible failure in transmission lines. The prime minister did not rule out the possibility of a terror attack. The mysterious collapse of much of the country's energy grid triggered a burst of wild conspiracy theories across social media. Some Twitter users went so far as to suggest the black-outs were a warm up for elections scheduled to take place in June. There is fertile ground for rumor-mongering in Turkey. Over the last five years, security forces have arrested hundreds of army generals, journalists, prosecutors, civil society activists and police commanders and accused them of being members of assorted plots aimed at toppling the government. The government's increasingly heavy-handed repression of public dissent, combined with overt censorship of the media and the internet, have also contributed to a hyper-polarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere. Even Turkey's veteran deputy prime minister, Bulent Arinc, recently observed that opposition supporters now look at him ""with hatred"" rather than the grudging respect he enjoyed when his political party first swept to power in elections in 2002. Meanwhile, mysterious black-outs are a sore spot for some Turks, after a surreal 2014 incident on election night -- allegedly involving a feline saboteur. That is -- a cat that allegedly wandered into a power transformer. That was almost exactly a year ago, a smaller series of power outages affected some polling stations during nationwide municipal elections, prompting unsubstantiated accusations of vote rigging. The ruling Justice and Development Party ended up winning by a comfortable margin, but few Turks were reassured by the energy minister's explanation that the voting day black-outs were caused by a cat getting lost. As electricity was just starting to come back on in Istanbul on Tuesday, a second crisis erupted. Websites linked to an extremist leftist militant group known as the DHKP-C began publishing chilling photos of a masked man holding a pistol to the head of a hostage in front of communist flags. Two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the Palace of Justice, the monolithic court house in the center of Istanbul. There they took hostage Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the prosecutor in charge of one of the most politically sensitive trials in the country. The gunmen demanded the confessions of police officers accused of shooting a tear gas canister at Berkin Elvan, a 15-year-old boy who was critically wounded during anti-government protests that raged across Istanbul in 2013. The boy's death after months in a medically-induced coma triggered a fresh burst of protests and riots against the government. On Tuesday, in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house, the Turkish government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the Palace of Justice siege. The broadcast ban is a measure that the Turkish government has repeatedly used in recent years to stifle reporting on deadly terrorist attacks. The government also famously shut down Twitter and YouTube in an effort to kill highly embarrassing political scandals involving corruption. Ultimately, Tuesday's court house siege ended in a deadly hail of bullets that left both gunmen dead and the prosecutor mortally wounded. Turkish officials say special forces raided the court house only after the militants began shooting. Online and in the streets, some Turks began linking the massive electricity blackouts to the hostage-taking inside one of Turkey's best-protected buildings, even though there is little to suggest the two incidents are connected. Just hours after the shooting, tensions exploded yet again at the court house. Istanbul's police chief had called for a press conference. As journalists jostled their way through security at the entrance to the largely deserted courthouse, some bystanders began chanting ""government thieves."" Just hours after a devastating lapse of security at the Palace of Justice, police began detaining the demonstrators hurling abuse at their elected government. The reactions to Tuesday's bewildering series of events revealed several truths about contemporary Turkey. The country is tense and confused after years of back-to-back political crises. Heavy-handed censorship has left the mainstream media widely distrusted and discredited by broad segments of society. And the absence of a common, credible space for sharing information has pushed critics of the government to the fringes of social media. Amid the burst of optimism and civil society activism in the early heady days of the Arab Spring in 2011, Turkey was often cited as a possible democratic model for countries in the Middle East.  Many of those Arab countries have since descended into conflict, repression and instability. In the meantime, Turkey feels increasingly vulnerable to demons of its own making.","This week, Turkey was gripped by a massive power outage and a deadly hostage crisis .

1901,"Faced with deplorable conditions at a ‘horrendous’ hotel in Cyprus, two lads from Cambridge tried to make the most of it by creating a hilarious video diary for their friends back home. The three-and-a-half minute video, titled ‘Never letting him book a hotel again’, offers a glimpse into every traveller’s nightmare – dirty rooms, antiquated or broken amenities and a swimming pool no one would dare to enter. With scenes reminiscent of The Inbetweeners films, the video was created by Patrick Miller and his friend, Damien, who stayed at the family-run hotel last week when they travelled to the Mediterranean island for a friend’s wedding. Patrick Miller, from Cambridge, 'swims' in the shallow end of the pool, which doesn't have any water . The deep end of the swimming pool at the hotel was filled with green sludge, dead insects and debris . Patrick Miller, a self-employed personal trainer, created the amusing video with friend Damien Rigden . Patrick said in the video, which has thousands of views on Facebook and YouTube, that he allowed Damien to book the room, and they thought they would be staying at a four-star hotel for three nights. But it didn’t live up to its billing and it didn't match the photos they saw online, as the pair were shocked to find conditions that could have made it one of the worst holidays ever. At the start of the tongue-in-cheek video, Patrick tells the camera: ‘I left all the planning to him. ‘He booked the accommodation and flights. He told me it was a four-star hotel, I was chuffed, and this little video’s going to show you how it panned out.’ Patrick's friend, Damien, stands under an outdoor shower, which no longer works, near the swimming pool . This screen grab from the pair's video shows the hot tub filled with stagnant water and dead flies . The pair explored the hotel, including bathrooms with exposed pipes or missing toilets, in the video . It shows the pair looking annoyed during a flight delay at the airport before they were ‘squashed’ on the plane with very little legroom. Things got worse at the hotel, where they found an unstaffed and empty bar, and a disgusting scene inside the outdoor swimming pool. Patrick, wearing his swimming trunks, decides to get a closer look at he climbs down the rickety ladder. The self-employed personal trainer says: ‘I might go for a quick dip. Don’t mind if I do. It’s lovely in here’. Patrick Miller stands in uncut, waist-high grass on the grounds of the 'four-star' hotel in Cyprus . The lads' hotel room overlooked a dirty car park, where a lorry was abandoned, and a busy road . The camera then pans to show him ‘swimming’ on the floor of the shallow end of the pool, which has no water. It then pans even further to the deep end, which is filled with green sludge, dead insects and debris. They find the same problems when Patrick checks out the hot tub. He sarcastically tells Damien: ‘Oh, ledge, I fancy a Jacuzzi before we play tennis. Oh no, I think there’s a fly in the water.’ Later scenes show a tennis court without the net strung up, an outdoor shower that doesn’t work, a depressing hotel room view of a dirt car park with an abandoned lorry, paint peeling off the walls, and lights that don’t work or fittings that are missing altogether. At one point in the video Patrick Miller stands on the dilapidated tennis court with no nets strung up . The hotel's grounds were a fiasco, with overgrown grass and trees and dead flowers . The grounds are a fiasco, with overgrown waist-high grass and trees, dead flowers and downed tree branches. In the end, Patrick said, the holidaymakers got what they paid for from their £15-a-night hotel room, which looked perfect online. He added: 'But when the taxi driver dropped us off there were no lights on at the hotel and no one at reception, so we were a bit scared and wondered what we had come to. The pair stayed at the hotel while they attended a friend's wedding on the Mediterranean island . Patrick said the staff were friendly but they spoke very little English, 'so it was a struggle' to communicate . 'Our room wasn't too bad, the sheets were clean and there was hot water, but when we looked in another bathroom there wasn't even a toilet.' He said the hotel was 'horrendous', but they decided to stay as it was just for a couple of days. 'Outside it was like a ghost town, there was no one about and no atmosphere. The staff were friendly but couldn't speak much English so it was a struggle. 'We tried to point out the problems but they couldn't really understand. We decided to just get on with it and make the best of it.'","Patrick Miller and his friend thought they were staying at a nicer hotel .

559,"China have said they are to start tracking the actions of their citizens abroad, following a string of reports about behaviour abroad. The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) said on its website on Monday that provincial and national authorities will be in touch with unruly citizens when they return to China, and if necessary, the police, customs officers, border control and even bank credit agencies will be contacted. They are hoping the strict measures will encourage Chinese tourists from doing anything inappropriate or illegal while abroad.

A group of Chinese travellers who scalded a flight attendant with hot water and noodles and threatened to blow up a plane. The passengers lashed out at cabin crew after they became enraged over sitting arrangements on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing . According to China People's Daily, bad behaviour will include: disorder on public transportation－including flights－damaging public facilities or historical relics, ignoring social customs at tourism destinations, and becoming involved with gambling or prostitution. Research by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that there were 109 million Chinese tourists in 2014, who spent $164 billion. These figures are a dramatic increase from the 10 million outbound tourists in 2000, and reflected the rise in numbers of reports on disruptive behaviour. It has been suggested that higher incomes have attributed to more Chinese citizens opting to spend their holidays outside of their country. The CNTA administration said in a separate post: 'tourism reflects on the country and the people's image,' and more 'social supervision' of tourists is needed. In December a brawl started on a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong over a woman's crying baby .

6943,"(CNN)The last time Frank Jordan spoke with his son, Louis Jordan was fishing on a sailboat a few miles off the South Carolina coast. The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. ""I thought I lost you,"" the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. ""I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me,"" Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. ""He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,"" Frank Jordan told CNN. ""And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal."" The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. ""Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices,"" Jordan said.  He was dead in the water. Jordan drifted in the Atlantic, rationing food and water until his shoulder healed. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. ""It took so long,"" he said.  ""It moved so slowly."" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. ""I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,"" Jordan said.  ""The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. ""Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket."" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. ""You're a good man, I swear.  You did what you are supposed to do, and I sure do appreciate it,"" he says. ""And I know my son appreciates it.""

5251,"(CNN)The mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, which began 100 years ago Friday, is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century, even though the word ""genocide"" did not exist at the time. The issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional, both for Armenians, who are descended from those killed, and for Turks, the heirs to the Ottomans. For both groups, the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts. Some Armenians feel their nationhood cannot be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged. Some Turks still view the Armenians as having been a threat to the Ottoman Empire in a time of war, and say many people of various ethnicities -- including Turks -- were killed in the chaos of war. In addition, some Turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations. So, what do we know about happened in those fateful days? Here are some answers: . The Ottoman Turks, having recently entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were worried that Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire would offer wartime assistance to Russia. Russia had long coveted control of Constantinople (now Istanbul), which controlled access to the Black Sea -- and therefore access to Russia's only year-round seaports. Many historians agree that the number was about 2 million. However, victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million Armenians living in the Caucasus under Russian rule, some of whom were massacred by Ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through East Armenia and Azerbaijan. By 1914, Ottoman authorities were already portraying Armenians as a threat to the empire's security. Then, on the night of April 23-24, 1915, the authorities in Constantinople, the empire's capital, rounded up about 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. Many of them ended up deported or assassinated. April 24, known as Red Sunday, is commemorated as Genocide Remembrance Day by Armenians around the world. Friday is the 100th anniversary of that day. This is a major point of contention. Estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923, with not all of the victims in the Ottoman Empire. But most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918, made by Ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million. Whether due to killings or forced deportation, the number of Armenians living in Turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922. Almost any way one can imagine. While the  death toll is in dispute, photographs from the era document some mass killings. Some show Ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads, others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt. The victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning, torture, gas, poison, disease and starvation. Children were reported to have been loaded into boats, taken out to sea and thrown overboard. Rape, too, was frequently reported. In addition, according to the website armenian-genocide.org, ""The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly removed from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger."" No. Genocide was not even a word at the time, much less a legally defined crime. The word ""genocide"" was invented in 1944 by a Polish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin to describe the Nazis' systematic attempt to eradicate Jews from Europe. He formed the word by combining the Greek word for race with the Latin word for killing. Genocide became a crime in 1948, when the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The definition included acts meant ""to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" Armenia, the Vatican, the European Parliament, France, Russia and Canada. Germany is expected to join that group on Friday, the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings. Turkey, the United States, the European Commission, the United Kingdom and the United Nations. A U.N. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985, but current U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declines to use the word. Also, a year ago, on the eve of the 99th anniversary of Red Sunday, then-Turkish Prime Minister (now-President) Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings, which he said had ""inhumane consequences."" While Turkey vehemently continues to reject the word ""genocide,"" his remarks went further than those of any previous Turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of Armenians.","The 100th anniversary of the start of the mass killings will be commemorated Friday .

9178,"A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide. The teenager from Mossley, Greater Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, ordered the deadly toxin off the 'dark web'. He was unaware his online requests were being tracked by covert counter-terrorism officers who feared he was planning an attack. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court earlier this month. A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide . But he claimed he was attempting to buy the deadly poison because he wanted to commit suicide and was sentenced to a 12 month referral order. Officers from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit started investigating the teenager in January when they received information that he was attempting to obtain the poison. Officers were in contact with the boy over the dark web - a subsection of deep web which is not indexed by standard search engines so users are less likely to be monitored. During their covert communication he expressed an interest in buying the poison and also showed an awareness of its toxicity and potential for use in causing harm. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court (pictured) earlier this month . The 16-year-old  attempted to place an order on February 6 and also suggested he would make future purchases in larger quantities. Officers raided two homes in Tameside on February 16 and the 16-year-old boy was arrested. A 16-year-old girl was also arrested as part of the investigation but later released without charge. The dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website, and its successor that were recently shut down, was used to sell drugs in exchange for Bitcoins. Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers. Det Sgt Russell Stubbs said after the case: 'The teenager at the centre of this investigation is clearly a vulnerable, troubled young man and I hope now that this case is concluded he can get the help and support he needs to turn his life around. 'Thanks to the vigilance of officers from a number of different law enforcement agencies, we were able to intervene before this young man did get hold of such a deadly substance from a genuine seller. 'I want to reassure our communities that the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and local police are well aware of the potential dangers associated with internet activity on the 'dark web'. Law enforcement agencies use a range of investigative techniques to monitor and police unlawful internet activity. 'I would also urge parents of children to keep a very close eye on what their children are doing. Security measures are available to block certain sites and if you suspect your child is spending too much time on the Internet and you notice sudden changes in their behaviour then please report it. 'As in this case, the sooner we are able to identify someone either at risk or using the 'dark web' for criminal purposes the better chance we have to consider appropriate intervention options.' Last year, a graphic designer who fantasised about poisoning her mother after she forbade her from marrying the man became the first person to be prosecuted under the Biological Weapons Act. Kuntal Patel, from Stratford, east London, had wished her 'selfish and controlling' mother Meena Patel dead after the 61-year-old was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her engagement, a court was told. During the trial at Southwark Crown Court, the court heard the 37-year-old contacted a dealer in the U.S through the 'dark web' and said she needed a 'tasteless' and deadly toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'.

10757,"Christian Benteke has revealed a secret. Despite what appeared cast-iron evidence to the contrary, he does not practise free-kicks. He has taken only a handful in his career. Yet with seven minutes to go in a game Aston Villa dared not lose, he stepped forward, pushing aside team-mates, to curl his dead-ball opportunity over the Queens Park Rangers wall and into the net. Precious point rescued. ‘I surprised myself!’ he says, laughing. ‘When I saw it, Charles N’Zogbia said, “I want to shoot”. But I said, “I want to take it”. Christian Benteke bends a free-kick over the QPR wall to rescue a point for Aston Villa last week . Benteke jumps for joy after sealing his hat-trick in the relegation battle with QPR at Villa Park . The Belgium striker admitted he even surprised himself by finding the back of the net with the free kick . ‘It wasn’t about the hat-trick, it was more about if I can take the free-kick or not, if I can hit the target. I have only taken one before for Villa, against Swansea, and I hit the post.’ What happens should a chance come from similar range against Liverpool? ‘I’ll take it. Sometimes you have to try.’ So speaks a striker of soaring confidence. Eight goals in his last six games, the latest a towering header to take all three points at Tottenham, Benteke is bang in form and relishing the prospect of an FA Cup semi-final. Sitting to discuss the match in a dressing room at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training complex, he looks as if he would like to be on Wembley’s turf post-haste. He has been rejuvenated under Tim Sherwood, scoring a goal every 87 minutes since the new Villa manager took over. The unnerving thing for Liverpool is that he says he will get better. Benteke rises above Fererico Fazio to head the winning goal for Aston Villa against Tottenham on Saturday . Benteke points to the sky in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches . Benteke is in the kind of form which could see Tim Sherwood's Villa escape from Premier League relegation . ‘I still think I can do more, in everything,’ he insists. ‘I can’t say I’m happy to be there now, I want to do more and more.’ That insatiable appetite is understandable after a disheartening year, starved first of football, then chances. It was April 3, 2014, when a loud crack was heard across Bodymoor’s training pitches signalling Benteke’s ruptured achilles. His World Cup dream was over. Parents Jean-Pierre and Marie-Claire cancelled their tickets to Brazil. Six months of rehabilitation followed before Benteke’s return last October. A red card on his third start against Tottenham kept him out for another brief period. There was a splendid goal at Crystal Palace, then another against Manchester United. A third came against Blackpool in the FA Cup third round. Dazzlingly good, but these strikes were isolated. Benteke never appeared his barnstorming self. His movement was limited, his impact negligible. Villa’s safety-first style was a significant factor. Often Benteke looked cut adrift up front. The nadir came when Paul Lambert dropped him to the bench for the visit of Chelsea in February. ‘It was frustrating because I knew I could do better,’ he says, reflecting on that moment. ‘Every time after the game I said to myself, “I can do better”. It was frustrating to play a game with no chances. But I am not that guy who is going to complain. I understood the situation.’ Sherwood’s impact has been immediate. Just as he did with Emmanuel Adebayor at Tottenham, he has taken a misfiring striker and recalibrated the shooting. Sherwood’s tactics are tailored to Benteke and his relentless positivity has awoken the inner beast. Benteke was forced to watch Belgium reach the quarter-final of the World Cup after rupturing his achilles . Benteke praised the impact of new manager Sherwood for playing a style that suits the striker's attributes . ‘He has given me a lot of freedom and he has said to the other lads to play maybe more direct with me,’ explains Benteke. ‘When a manager says that, you feel more important, more responsible. ‘The way that we play now is comfortable for me because I’m scoring and also for the team because I help the team.’ He is excited about his partnership with Gabby Agbonlahor. ‘He helps me destroy the defenders. With two we’re always better than one.’ Benteke is grateful to Lambert for bringing him to Villa from Genk in 2012 but acknowledges it was the correct call to sack the manager. ‘That’s a tough question,’ he pauses. ‘I will say yes because the confidence of the team was a little bit low and when the gaffer came he brought the confidence up.’ Benteke believes his fitness after such a long time out was an issue too but now he feels in peak condition. ‘I play like I used to before. I feel really good.’ Those summer weeks when he could only watch his nation’s World Cup adventure on TV are becoming a distant, if difficult, memory. Benteke is delighted with the partnership he has struck up with fellow striker Gabby Agbonlahor . The striker paid tribute to former manager Paul Lambert for signing him from Genk in 2012 . ‘It was tough,’ he says. ‘I worked hard for that opportunity. But that’s life. The manager Marc Wilmots said, “If you want, you can come with the lads.” But I didn’t. I came back to Belgium and my family helped get me through. My mum said, “You have to be thankful to God, it could have been worse”.’ Becoming a father to baby Jayden last September put things in perspective. ‘It was good, I forgot about my injury,’ he says, smiling. Doubts about his talent emerged during his troubles but he has faced down critics before. Three years ago Genk dismissed his Premier League credentials. ‘They said I wasn’t ready because the level between Belgium and England is really high and I should stay one more season. But I said, “No, I am confident, I want to go”. I don’t really listen to what people say. If I feel it, I just do it. But Benteke concedes that sacking Lambert was the correct decision after the lift Sherwood has given them . Chelsea midfielder and compatriot Eden Hazard tweeted his admiration for Benteke after his Spurs winner . ‘It was my dream to play in the best league. I was a fan of Arsenal.’ He insists he is not dreaming of scoring at Wembley. ‘I don’t want a dream, I want to do it.’ He is not that close to compatriot Simon Mignolet but is good friends with Marouane Fellaini and Eden Hazard. ‘I have known them since I was really young.’ Hazard tweeted his admiration following Benteke’s goal at Spurs. ‘He is my brother, like you say. For me, he deserves to be the Player of the Year.’ Benteke will consider what he deserves in the summer. Wolfsburg have been keeping tabs on him. ‘Since I came I have had a lot of pressure here,’ he says. ‘If I want to one day, after say four or five years, be with the big club, then it is pressure every time also.’ He ultimately wants European football. That will come for Villa by reaching the final, should Arsenal also qualify. ‘I think this is the beauty of the FA Cup, now everything is possible,’ he says.","Aston Villa face Liverpool at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday .

2400,"A Muslim cleric has issued a fatwa ordering a woman to agree to sex with her husband even if they are on the back of a camel, as he denounces the idea of marital rape as 'made up by European people'. Perak Mufti Tan Sri Harussani Zakaria claims that, according to the Prophet Mohammed, a wife can only refuse her husband sex if she is menstruating, sick or just given birth. Her right to say no, he asserted, was lost the moment her father handed her to her new husband. Outrageous: Perak Mufti Tan Sri Harussani Zakaria said women should never say no to their husbands - and claimed marital rape was 'made up' by Europeans, so there was no need for Muslims to take any notice . Zakaria told Malay Mail Online:  'Even the Prophet says even when they're riding on the back of the camel, when the husband asks her, she must give. 'So there's no such thing as rape in marriage. This is made by European people, why should we follow?' Unsurprisingly, his religious edict and outrageous comments have horrified many in his home country of Malaysia and beyond. Writing in MalaysiaKini.com, Joshua Teh, an advocacy officer at the Women’s Centre for Change in Penang, said: 'Have we not provided excuses for rapists long enough? 'We need to recognise that women, both married and not married, have the right over their own bodies, and that includes the right to reject sex. 'To turn a blind eye to that right is to reduce the woman’s dignity as a person and to further normalise the prevalence of sexual crimes in our society.' Disgusted: His claim that women couldn't even say no if they were on a camel has horrified many in the mainly Muslim country, where an estimated 3,000 women a year are raped . However, another mufti has said sex between a married couple must take place in a 'harmonious situation so as not to hurt each other' - which means rape is not possible. What's more, Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin - known as 'Dr Maz' - has said a man is not allowed to refuse sex with his wife, nor is he allowed to stop without 'getting consensus from his wife for fear that she did not have time to enjoy'.","Malaysian cleric claims marital rape is  'made up by European people'

1581,"Incredible footage has  captured the moment a huge stingray nibbles on a freediver’s head, gliding back and forth over the man’s body gently on the ocean floor. The video shows the incredibly peaceful encounter between the ray and Johnny Debnam, a 29-year-old commercial diver and ocean lover. Mr Debnam was free diving in water four metres deep; holding his breath and diving down to the depths of the ocean on Rottnest Island off the coast of Western Australia. Johnny Debnam says he felt completely at ease with the stingray, although he was aware of the risks . The commercial diver was free diving four metres beneath the ocean when he had his snuggle with the ray . ‘I was totally at peace. I loved that thing going over the top of me,’ Johnny Debnam said of the experience . The video shows the swimmer completely motionless in the seagrass, with the enormous 150 kilogram ray rubbing itself back and forward over his body - even nibbling at his head. ‘I blew all my air out and was totally calm and at his level,’ explained Mr Debnam during a mini documentary produced for his production company Terra Australis TV. Mr Debnam was completely enveloped underneath the stingray, but he remained calm and insists he relished every minute of the wonderful experience. The stingray is a potentially dangerous creature. If provoked it may use its spiky tail – known as a barb- to spear the victim and inject them with a deadly poison. Tragically, animal activist and Australian icon Steve Irwin was killed after a deadly encounter with a stingray. In September 2006 the creature stabbed him with its barb 'hundreds of times' as he filmed a documentary near Queensland's Great Barrier Reef. However Mr Debnam's relationship with the stingray was incredibly harmonious. He is experienced with marine life and in the video demonstrates his behaviour to be gentle and threatening, and the stingray appears to reward him with some appreciative cuddles! Johnny Debnam did not have any breathing equipment on when he let all his air out and calmly lay still on the ocean floor . The majestic stingray swum over him three times, enveloping him under his body as he glided on top . ‘Those things are huge. They’re massive and they could really mess you up if they wanted to,’ Debnam said during his Terris Australis TV documentary. ‘But, they won’t if they don’t want to.’ Responding to his calm nature, the curious stingray repeatedly glides over him, as if to try to determine what exactly it had found nestled amongst the reeds. Debnam is ecstatic after his snuggled with the majestic, friendly creature. ‘I was totally at peace. I loved that thing going over the top of me,’ he said. ‘It was awesome! It did it three times and I wanted it to do it again. ‘It was a bit of a rush really!’ Responding to his calm nature, the curious stingray repeatedly glides over him, as if to try to determine what exactly it had found nestled amongst the reeds . The production company he co-created, Terra Australis TV, specialises in creating stunning cinematography of the incredible creatures beneath the ocean’s surface in Western Australia. Debnam and his cameraman Cameron Wallace are passionate about showing the ocean respect whilst exploring and filming the wonders of the sea. ‘That’s what makes you feel alive. Natural, awesome, pure things like (swimming with a stingray),’ said Debnam. ‘You can’t buy it.’ See www.terraaustralis.tv .

5992,"One-eyed police killer Dale Cregan has been sent to the same psychiatric hospital as Moors murderer Ian Brady after going on hunger strike for the second time. The 31-year-old has reportedly been transferred from HMP Manchester, formerly Strangeways, to Ashworth Hospital, a high-security psychiatric unit in Maghull, Merseyside. Cregan, who was jailed for life after shooting police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in 2012, was said to have started refusing food at the Category A jail after being moved to solitary confinement. Scroll down for video . One-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan (above left) has reportedly been  moved from the Category A prison to the same secure psychiatric hospital as Moors murderer Ian Brady (above right) A source said told the Sun: 'He's playing the system. 'If he's offered a move he likes, he will start eating.' Brady, who was jailed for life in 1966, was sent to Ashworth Hospital over 30 years ago. Together with Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, he tortured and murdered five children in Greater Manchester between 1963 and 1965. In 2013 a mental health tribunal ruled that Brady should stay at Ashworth, despite the notorious killer arguing that he was not suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and should go back to jail. Cregan, who lost an eye in a brawl, was told he would die in prison when he was jailed for life without parole in June 2013. He was already on the run for the murders of David Short, 46, and son Mark, 23, when he killed the two policewomen after luring them to a house with a fake 999 call before shooting them 32 times on the doorstep and then throwing a grenade at them. It was claimed he was sent to solitary confinement at HMP Manchester last month after being caught smuggling a mobile phone and cannabis into his cell. Before the fallout sources told the Daily Star Sunday that Cregan had an enhanced status and was allowed additional time in the games area and yard, as well as a flat-screen TV and DVD player in his room.

'He has not eaten since he was sent into segregation.' Ashworth hospital offers comfortable bedrooms and patients are allowed personal items such as CDs, photos and books. Art and music workshops, pottery and cooking classes, and social events such as bingo and film nights are also offered to the patients.

9365,"A young fisherman in Thailand reeled in the catch of the day after hooking a fish with a plastic toy fishing rod – but was the achievement just a hoax? Captured standing on the bank of what appears to be a lake, the youngster – with a big grin on his face – holds onto a tiny blue and yellow fishing rod. Approaching the water, the young boy reels rapidly, but at this point it isn’t clear whether or not he has hooked anything. The youngster stands on the bank of what appears to be a lake  and holds a tiny blue and yellow fishing rod . He then crouches down by the side of the water and moves his rod from side to side – tension on the end of it is now visible. Fighting against what may well be a weed, the young boy continues to reel and before long a fish breaks the surface of the water. As it splashes about, the youngster puts his hand into the lake and plucks it out. He then lays it on the floor before confidently putting his finger in its mouth, removing the hook and proudly lifting it up to the camera. The young Thai boy crouches down by the side of the water and moves his rod from side to side while reeling . Discussing the video with MailOnline, Nathan Wardle of Mega Fishing Thailand, said that the fish was most likely a Nile Tilapia, although it is hard to see exactly from the clip. He added: ‘They are found in almost every river, lake or pond right through the whole of Thailand and were introduced back in 1967 as a gift from Japan to the Thai King. ‘Many people farm them in small numbers in their ponds for food. The fry can be bought for about 8p each. ‘They are very popular stocked in fishing parks where they will cook your catch and small ones are used as bait for the big monster fish we have here. The fish breaks the surface of the water and the boy bravely puts his hand into the lake to catch it . The boy plucks the fish from the water, lays it on the floor and confidently puts his finger in its mouth to remove the hook . ‘They are also great table fish, served up in most restaurants. They have really tasty meat that can be fried, poached, roasted or barbecued and usually come with some kind of spicy Thai dipping sauce. ‘The fish eat pretty much anything so are fairly easy to catch with worms, bread, shrimps or squid and the like.’ Since it was uploaded, the video has been viewed over a million times and many people have commented to congratulate the youngster. However, there is a suggestion that the fish may have been hooked to the line before the start of the video.

7039,"The reserve deputy who shot a suspect dead after firing his gun instead of his Taser was investigated in 2009 over his questionable training and erratic behavior in the field. Robert Bates, 73, appeared in Tulsa district court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter over the death of Eric Harris, who was killed during a botched sting on April 2. Since the incident there have been allegations Bates was not properly trained and it is now emerged that when previously confronted by other deputies over his behavior, he told them he could do whatever he wanted. Scroll down for video . Heading to court: Robert Bates, left, is seen walking to court on Tuesday morning with his attorney Corbin Brewster, right, before he entered his not-guilty plea in the death of Eric Harris earlier this month . 'Mistake': The 73-year-old reserve deputy claims he mistakenly pulled out his gun instead of his Taser and shot dead the man as he fled the scene of an undercover operation on April 2 . In 2009, the Tulsa Sheriff's Office concluded after an internal investigation that Bates had received special treatment during training and while working as a reserve deputy, CBS News reports. The investigation found that other deputies raised concerns about Bates' behavior in the field, almost from the start of his tenure. He was said to have used his personal car while on duty and made unauthorized vehicle stops. The inquiry came to the conclusion that high-ranking officers created an atmosphere where employees were intimidated about reporting violations of department policy. Dan Smolen, the attorney for Eric Harris, claimed that if the investigation's findings had been acted on in 2009 Harris might still be alive. He told CBS News: 'I think there are so many people who look on at so much corruption it's more than just a couple of people.' Charged: Bates (left in his mug shot) shot Harris (pictured right) and faces four years in prison if convicted . A spokesman for the Tulsa Sheriff acknowledged that some type of internal review was conducted, but that there was no further action taken. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said this week he believes that Bates received his required training. Bates, a Tulsa County volunteer, shot Harris, 44, after the man was confronted during an undercover gun-sale operation and ran past him. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after Harris. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the disturbing clip, which was released by the sheriff's office, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him! I'm sorry.' The fatally-wounded father can be heard saying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' Earlier this week the Harris family expressed their anger after learning that retired insurance executive Bates, who is out on $25,000 bond, would be allowed to take a month-long vacation to the Bahamas. A statement released by the family read: 'Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life,' they said. Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' 'At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege.' It is not clear when he is leaving for the holiday but Bates will next appear in court on July 2. He has previously visited the Bahamas with the sheriff, Stanley Glanz, and another reserve deputy and paid for part of Glanz's trip. In separate news conferences on Monday, the county sheriff and lawyers for Harris' family disagreed on whether the reserve officer should have been allowed to conduct police work. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Bates, his long-time insurance agent and former campaign manager, had been properly trained and passed annual firearms certifications required by the state. Dan Smolen, the lawyer for Harris' family, said the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office violated a number of its internal policies by letting Bates carry his personal handgun after training with another weapon. Smolen also said the department failed to keep a permanent record of Bates' training, in violation of local policies. Records Bates released during the weekend showed that the volunteer officer was trained on a .45, not the weapon used in Harris' death. Bates, who sold his insurance business for $6 million in 1999, was trained to be a Tulsa Police Department patrolman in 1964 but left in 1965. He was out of law enforcement for 35 years, returning for volunteer work in Florida in 2000 before joining the Tulsa County force in 2008 and making a number of donations to the agency. He also was Glanz's campaign manager during the 2012 election. Anger: Harris' son Aidan Fraley (pictured right with his uncle Andre Harris a week after his father's death), has said the police officers who allowed Bates to become a cop should be held accountable for his death . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . During an appearance on the Today show last week, he apologized to Harris' family. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' He also insisted that, despite keeping his gun and Taser on different parts of his uniform, it was easy to confuse the two. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates said. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' Harris' son responded by saying that the volunteer deputy was too old to be on the police force. 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad,' Aidan Fraley said, NBC reported.

6842,"The Oyston family served to form a further wedge between themselves and Blackpool’s fans after a pensioner was forced to pay a staggering £20,000 in damages for allegations made online. Frank Knight, a lifelong supporter of the Seasiders, was ordered to make a public apology after posting a disparaging status on his Facebook page this time last year. Knight currently has 34 friends on his private account and this is the third instance in a matter of months whereby a fan of the club has settled before court proceedings with owner Owen Oyston and his son, chairman Karl. Blackpool fans vent their disgust at the Oyston family, who own the club, last week . Supporters have been protesting against the Oystons before matches and then not attending the games . Another supporter is awaiting a court date with the Oystons after making defamatory remarks online. Karl Oyston is to soon find out his fate for branding a fan a ‘retard’ before Christmas, telling him to ‘enjoy your special needs day out’ and claiming he was banned from the ground because he was a ‘p****’. Blackpool’s recent history has been entrenched in bitter disputes off the pitch, with paying customers regularly protesting at the ownership of their club. That was compounded last week when Lee Clark and his team’s relegation to League One was confirmed. Dozens pelted the Bloomfield Road reception with eggs and flares before their draw against Reading last Tuesday. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston speaks on his mobile phone during Tuesday's draw with Reading . Owner Owen Oyston watches the match huddled under a blanket in the stands . Blackpool fan Frank Knight posted an apology on a supporters' messageboard on Thursday . A group also travelled to the Oyston home near Waddington, Lancashire on Sunday to vent their fury. Members of the family stood within the grounds and watched as they protested in front of the gates. And Knight’s apology will only serve to exasperate the problem further. Posting on a fans’ messageboard, the pensioner said: ‘I now regret making these allegations, I fully accept that they are false and I wish to sincerely apologise for them and also for the harm, distress and financial losses my comments have caused both BFC and the Oystons and I wish to unreservedly withdraw them. ‘I accept that my publication of the allegations on Facebook and in a manner which is readily accessible to users constitutes a very serious libel. It has injured the reputation of the Oystons and has caused them considerable embarrassment and distress. Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Broken eggs on the floor outside Bloomfield Road . ‘It has damaged their reputation in business and it is considered to be grossly defamatory of the position of the Oystons within the Club, within the football hierarchy and within the football community in general, as well as within the local community for it to be even suggested that either or both of the Oystons were not only aware of such alleged activities but also that either or both of the Oystons actually condoned them. ‘In recognition of this, I have agreed with their suggestion that I should pay to BFC, by way of damages, costs, disbursements and interest and in full and final settlement of all matters in issue between myself and BFC and the Oystons, the sum of £20,000.00. ‘After a frank discussion with the Oystons, I acknowledge that they are both genuine fans of BFC and they and their families have only the best interests of BFC at heart. I recognise that BFC is now in a significantly healthier situation than when the Oyston family first became involved in it. I note that the combined net assets value at cost of Segesta and BFC were £32 million as at May 2014, compared with -£42,000 as at May 1987, when the Oystons took over BFC. I accept the Oyston family’s main objective is and always has been, for the financial stability and success for and of BFC.’ Blackpool and Mr Knight offered no comment when contacted by Sportsmail.","Lifelong Blackpool fan Frank Knight forced to pay £20,000 in damages .

The UK’s biggest mobile network has announced details of a scheme to help customers keep their mobile phones charged. EE shops are planning to give away free portable chargers so that people can revive their phones wherever they are. Once the EE ‘power bar’ runs down, customers will be able to swap it for a new one at any EE shop, or spend four hours charging it up themselves at home. The chargers will be free to EE customers, and other smartphone owners can also sign up to the service if they pay a £20 fee. EE said that battery-draining video streaming and social media site browsing now accounted for more than 50 per cent of all data use on their network. Its research found that almost 60 per cent of smartphone users found their battery would not last a full day. And over half said they wish there were more ways to charge their phone in public places – rising to over 70 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds. The firm’s marketing officer, Pippa Dunn, said: ‘Almost everyone’s experienced the frustration associated with running out of battery, it seems to happen when you need your phone the most. ‘We’re giving customers a power bar that can be swapped for a fully charged one at any of our stores, at any time, for free.’ Powered up: EE customers will able to pick up free portable chargers from shops to stop their phones from running out of battery .","EE shops will stock free chargers so people can revive phones while out .

10302,"China is creating a 'great wall of sand' in the South China Sea, the US Navy has said. The latest huge land mass is 1.5 square miles (four square kilometres) in size and was created by dumping sand on live coral reefs, possibly damaging local ecosystems. But this is just one of several artificial islands China has been creating in the region - and the exact purpose of them is unknown. China is creating a 'great wall of sand' in the South China Sea, the US Navy has claimed. Five islands have already been made, with two more in development. This image shows the Johnson Reef on 25 February 2014, which has seen land added drastically over the last three years. A Chinese vessel is seen at the top . The large expanses of sand and concrete - the latest being Johnson Reef - are being built among the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. China is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea, and then dumping it on subermeged coral reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen - a geopolitical researcher in China - explained. And experts have told MailOnline that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems. China has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region. Five islands in total have been built in this way, and two more are in development. Richard Dodge of the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center, said: 'The activities described would appear to clearly both be greatly exceeding corals and coral reefs’ ability to cope and survive the excess sediments and turbidity.' He said that as the reefs were being covered by cement and landfill, this constituted 'outright destruction' of the buried coral reefs and associated habitats. 'Coral reefs are extremely globally and locally valuable both for the biodiversity and ecosystem they create but also for the tremendous services they provide in terms of food supply, cultural heritage, erosion prevention, recreation, tourism, and habitat for myriad other organisms,' he continued. 'Coral reefs worldwide are under extreme threat from changing climate and from local sources of land based pollution, over fishing, and coastal construction. 'The activities described would appear to represent an additional and severe threat to coral reef ecosystem health and sustainability.' Robert Nicholls, a Professor of Coastal Engineering at the University of Southampton, added: 'It is clearly destroying [coral reefs] at the local scale of the land claim and the environment. 'In the bigger scheme of things it is harder to be precise as these are small areas in a large area of reef.' Experts have told MailOnline that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems. China has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region. The extent of how much damage is being done is seen in this image . This photo released by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, shows what the Johnson Reef looked like on 28 February 2013. A Chinese-made structure stands on the Johnson Reef, called Mabini by the Philippines and Chigua by China, in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea . This photo, taken on 13 March 2012, shows what the Johnson Reef looked like before China started to build there. The Philippines has protested China's reclamation of land in the disputed reef in the South China Sea that can be used to build an airstrip or an offshore military base in the increasingly volatile region . Yesterday, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet - Admiral Harry Harris Jr - warned that the constructions were 'increasing regional tensions and the potential for miscalculation.' 'China is building artificial land by pumping sand on to live coral reefs - some of them submerged - and paving over them with concrete. China has now created over 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) of artificial landmass,' he said. Harris said the region is known for its beautiful natural islands, but 'in sharp contrast, China is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers over the course of months.' China claims virtually all of the South China Sea, but the Philippines and other countries which have territorial disputes with China in the busy sea have been particularly concerned by the land reclamation projects. These have turned a number of previously submerged reefs in the Spratlys archipelago into artificial islands with buildings, runways and wharves. The islands could be used for military and other facilities to bolster China's territorial claims. The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake. China is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea, and then dump it on subermeged reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen - a geopolitical researcher in China - explained. Shown is an image of a dredging vessel in San Francisco, demonstrating how land can be moved from underwater . Harris said the pace of China's construction of artificial islands 'raises serious questions about Chinese intentions.' He said the US continues to urge all claimants to conform to the 2002 China-ASEAN Declaration of Conduct, in which the parties committed to 'exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability.' 'How China proceeds will be a key indicator of whether the region is heading toward confrontation or cooperation,' he said. The US says it has a national interest in the peaceful resolution of the disputes in a region crucial for world trade. China says its territorial claims have a historical basis and objects to what it considers US meddling.","China is building artificial islands on coral reefs in the South China Sea .

5120,"Spiders on Mars may have been predicted by David Bowie, but in fact spiders in space could help us get to the red planet. Tether Unlimited has revealed a system of robo spiders than can construct solar panels, trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit. The Nasa-back firm says it could dramatically reduce the cost of building spacecraft by allowing the final construction to take place in orbit. Scroll down for video . The system uses arachnid-like robots to construct large objects in orbit around the Earth by 'spinning' building material into shape. SpiderFab uses arachnid-like droids to construct large objects in orbit. SpiderFab could cut construction costs by only launching raw materials such as carbon fibre into orbit. The robots can then piece together the materials while in orbit, finishing off the spacecraft. The futuristic new system – dubbed SpiderFab – is being developed by a company called Tethers Unlimited. The system uses arachnid-like robots to construct large objects in orbit around the Earth or further into the Solar System. 'This process will enable space systems to be launched in a compact and durable 'embryonic' state,' the firm says. 'Once on orbit, these systems will use techniques evolved from emerging additive manufacturing and automated assembly technologies to fabricate and integrate components such as antennas, shrouds, booms, concentrators, and optics. 'The primary benefit of this on-orbit fabrication capability will be order-of-magnitude improvements in packing efficiency and system mass, which will enable NASA to use small, low-cost launch vehicles to deploy systems dramatically larger than possible with current state-of-the-art technologies. 'The net payoff will be to enable NASA to acquire and distribute a variety of forms of data at higher resolution, higher bandwidth, higher signal-to-noise, and lower life-cycle cost.' 'Our really long-term objective for all of this work is to eventually enable the use of in-situ resources to construct the infrastructure in space needed to support humanity's expansion throughout the solar system,' Dr. Robert Hoyt claimed last month during a presentation with NASA's Future In-Space Operations (FISO) working group. Under a Nasa contract, the firm is currently implementing the first step in the SpiderFab architecture: a machine that uses 3D printing techniques and robotic assembly to fabricate long, high-performance truss structures. He says the current way we build spacecraft is flawed. 'It's a very expensive and time-consuming process, and also, the size of systems is somewhat limited by the size of the deployables that are possible to fold up and fit within a launch shroud,' he said. Tethers Unlimited hopes to launch its first working construction robot into space within the next couple of years. 'In a perfect world — if funding flowed and the contracting process didn't drag on forever — we think we could get to be able to build very large support structures for antennas and solar arrays, and those sorts of components, in the early 2020s,' Dr. Hoyt said. The 'Trusselator' device will enable construction of large support structures for systems such as multi-hundred-kilowat solar arrays, large solar sails, and football-field sized antennas.

Now the iconic van is about to get greener because the bus is being reborn as an electric vehicle, a Volkswagen board member revealed. No images of the new vehicle have yet been released, but Dr Heinz-Jakob Neusser suggested that battery packs would be hidden under the vehicle's floor and a small electric motor will drive its front wheels. The iconic Volkswagen Westfalia Camper (pictured here including an extendable roof) is about to get greener, because the bus will be reborn as an electric vehicle, a Volkswagen board member revealed . The Volkswagen Westfalia Camper ceased production in 2003, and while VW has rolled out two concept 'microbuses' in recent years, neither have the charm or iconic good looks of its original. Speaking at the New York International Auto Show, Dr Neusser didn’t give any specific design details away, but said that the new version will share some features with the Westfalia Camper, because the placement of the motor and batteries will allow designers to borrow aspects of the original 1950s design. Speaking at the New York International Auto Show, Dr Neusser didn’t give any specific design details away, but said that the new version will share at least three key features with the Westfalia Camper. Volkswagen has unveiled two prototype 'microbuses' including the Bulli (pictured) in recent years . No images of the new vehicle have yet been released, but Dr Heinz-Jakob Neusser suggested that battery packs would be hidden under the floor in the vehicle and a small electric motor will drive its front wheels, making the new Camper van more environmentally friendly than its predecessor (an example is pictured) No images or name has been announced for the Westfalia Camper version 2.0. It's expected to be an electric vehicle with batteries stashed beneath the floor. A small electric motor will drive its front wheels. Compact technology will enable designers to keep 1950s features. A concept is expected to be revealed in two to five years’ time. 'It’s easy to bring battery space into such a vehicle, because you can put them under the floor. We have these systems already,' he told AutoExpress. By eliminating the need for a conventional petrol engine, VW's designers could position the cabin further forward, to mimic the layout of the original. Engineers are currently working on the concept car and Dr Neusser said that the design will go into production if it’s financially viable. It's expected that the concept will be revealed in two to five years time. The German automaker resurrected its beloved Beetle in 1997, after various iterations of the model were made for over six decades, between 1938 and 2003, suggesting it may repeat this success story with the VW Camper. Engineers are currently working on the concept car and Dr Neusser said that the design will go into production if it’s financially viable. VW also unveiled four prototype Beetles at the US auto show, including the orange Beetle Wave (pictured) which features fabric patterns from the 1950s and 60s as well as a wooden dashboard . It unveiled four new concepts for its Beetle car, including two coupés and two cabriolets. One of them is the Beetle Cabriolet Denim, which comes in ‘stonewashed blue metallic’ with a denim-like texture on the soft roof, while the orange Beetle Wave features fabric patterns from the 1950s and 60s as well as a wooden dashboard, which the company says ‘reflects the American spirit on the East and West coast beaches of the USA’. The Beetle Pink Edition is simply pink, but the R-Line Concept is a sporty version with a 2.0 TSI engine, wrap-around body panelling, a black diffuser and large rear spoiler.

8742,"A woman on trial for murder admitted in a recorded interview with police that she had shot two men and fed their bodies to her pigs, the jury heard on Tuesday. Susan Monica, a 66-year-old pig farmer and welder from southern Oregon, went on trial on Tuesday in Medford. She has been charged with killing two handymen living on her 20-acre pig ranch in a small Jackson County community and dismembering the bodies. Accused serial killer Susan Monica interrupts court in Medford, Oregon on Tuesday on the opening day of her trial for allegedly murdering two men, dismembering their bodies and feeding them to her pigs . Susan Monica, pictured left in court in January 2014, and right in an undated mugshot, has been accused of killing Robert Haney and Stephen Delicino a year apart at her pig farm and dismembering their bodies . Both victims were shot in the head and dismembered in what prosecutors allege were separate murders committed more than a year apart. Monica appeared in court dressed in skirt, blouse and short wig. In opening statements, defense lawyer Garren Pedemonte said Monica shot the first victim in self-defense, and the second as a kind of mercy killing. Stephen Frank Delicino, 59, was shot by Monica in self-defense in summer 2012. The defendant has claimed that she shot the second man, 56-year-old Robert Harry Haney, to put him out of his misery because she found her pigs already feeding on him, The Mail Tribune reported. The second killing took place in September 2013. Police searched her pig ranch last year after Monica was discovered using a food stamps card belonging to Haney, and found remains of the two men.

539,"Two property developers branded 'arrogant and greedy' by a judge have been jailed after a three-storey building collapsed trapping three people in the rubble. A doctor's wife and a student plunged from the living rooms of their flats into the basement below  and a workman was buried after a digger struck a load-bearing column. The accident left three victims hospitalised with minor injuries, while 20 students were left homeless and one of Sheffield's main arterial roads was closed for a day. Most of the students who lived in flats above the development in the Brook Hill area of the South Yorkshire city were luckily out at the time and missed the accident. Jailing brothers Naveed and Rizwan Hussain for 12 months each today, Judge Michael Murphy told them: 'It was only by the grace of God or good fortune that people were not seriously injured or killed. 'If a member of the public had been passing by they would have said ""How on earth was no-one killed in that?"" There was potential for a complete disaster. It was caused by your arrogance and greed.' Before: Students and a doctor and his wife lived above the retail premises in Sheffield until the 2013 incident. Three people were injured and the building's collapse caused the main road to be closed off . After: But the building was left looking like it had been hit by a bomb after botched work by landlords Naveed and Rizwan Hussain, who were jailed for health and safety offences today . Officers from the Health and Safety Executive spent two years and £150,000 investigating the collapse and bringing the defendants to justice for what was called a 'flagrant disregard' of Health and Safety regulations. Sheffield Crown Court heard that neither city landlord Naveed, 33, or Rizwan, 39, had any building experience, qualifications or planning permission for the structural works they were carrying out. Rizwan, who managed the shop in the building, and Naveed, the landlord of the flats above, were hoping to extend and reopen a former Indian restaurant on the site. Nigel Lawrence, prosecuting, said the flats above the retail premises were occupied by Sheffield University students as well as a doctor and his wife. A builder and a structural engineer were consulted over plans to lower the floor level and make the restaurant open-plan but the brothers then dispensed with their services. Although a planning application was submitted, permission had not been grantedwhen construction work on the restaurant started about four weeks before the collapse in March 2013. The student tenants complained about cracks in their walls and noise from drilling and machinery but Rizwan told them the restaurant would be open within four months and he would offer them jobs there. Naveed brought in an excavator and began removing rubble with the help of an odd-job man while Rizwan instructed other workmen. Pillars and internal walls were removed. Firemen had to make the building safe after the wall and upper floors caved in in March 2103 . The work meant a main road in Sheffield was closed off. The section of the building was later demolished . As the work progressed, the doctor confronted Naveed in the basement and was shocked to see the underside of the laminate floor in his flat above supported only by steel beams with large areas of wall removed. 'He asked Naveed if he and his wife should vacate the flat but Naveed assured him this was not necessary,' said Mr Lawrence. A week later student Kishore Chandrasekaran was in his flat when the wall and the floor collapsed, dropping him down onto a pile of rubble in the basement. He was trapped by his right leg but a table which fell on top of him protected him from falling debris. It was half an hour before he managed to struggle free. Doctor's wife Khushboo Shah was sat on the sofa in her lounge. 'She heard a noise like hailstones and the floor beneath her fell away and she fell to the basement together with a section of the building', said Mr Lawrence. She fell on the rubble and was covered in dust as well as being struck by falling pieces of wood. Both the first and second floors of the buildings collapsed and Naveed himself freed the handyman, known only as Mr Raja, from the rubble. The students lost their passports and laptops and their deposits on the flats were not returned. The part-ruined buildings were demolished by Sheffield City Council on safety grounds - with the taxpayer picking up the bill. Before the incident, two storeys of flats sat above the premises the brothers were trying to convert . An independent structural engineer called in to examine the mess said the work was 'inherently dangerous and a serious accident was foreseeable.' Mr Lawrence said: 'It was a miracle that nobody was either killed or seriously injured. It was pure good luck that most of the tenants were out of their homes and no member of the public was nearby.' David Webster for Naveed, a father-of-four who was convicted last year of unlawfully evicting a tenant, said the work was not 'wholly cavalier' from the outset but a measure of cost-cutting overtook prudence. 'The work was done with a highly reckless disregard not only for the safety of others but to my client himself,' he said. 'If there was anybody at the greatest risk it was the one who was in the basement. 'This was hamfisted, clueless, directionless and haphazard rather than calculated maliciousness in bringing down a building. His folly was to think he could turn his hand to this major project without any relevant training or experience.' James Horne, for Rizwan, said his involvement was confined to running the shop in the buildings owned by his father Sabir Hussain. The court heard had no financial interest in the flats and the intention was for the work to be done properly. Now builders are trying to completely re-build the premises after huge disruption caused by the accident . The court heard the father-of-seven had taken out a £488,000 bridging loan on the restaurant project guaranteed by properties belonging to his brother and was currently working as a chef. Naveed and Rizwan both admitted two offences contravening HSE regulations in failing to ensure themselves and their employees were not exposed to risk and failing to take steps to prevent danger to another person. Rizwan also admitted breaching a prohibition notice. As well as being jailed, Naveed was fined £40,000 and Rizwan was given a £42,000 fine. Naveed was ordered to pay £60,000 costs and Rizwan £40,000 costs. Judge Murphy told the brothers that their breaches of the regulations were 'blatant and financially motivated'. He said: 'People were terrified and there was inconvenience to untold numbers of people in Sheffield. The potential for disaster was staring everyone in the face apart from you.'","Completely unqualified brothers were trying to create an Indian restaurant .

Robert Tomanovich, who owns Robert's Discount Tree Service in Livonia, Michigan, first hung a noose from a tree and a Confederate flag, printed with the slogan 'I ain't coming down,' on a fence at his home. When neighbours complained, a second noose appeared on a tree outside his tree-cutting business which operates at a second property on the same street. Robert Tomanovich is under fire from unhappy neighbours in Livonia, a suburb of Detroit, after he hung a Confederate flag and nooses at his two properties in the area . Tomanovich first hung a noose from a tree and a Confederate flag, printed with the slogan 'I ain't coming down,' on a fence at his Michigan home . Tomanovich, 55, has denied his actions are racist, although an employee has admitted that the second noose was a deliberate move to antagonise locals. 'One hundred fifty years after Abraham Lincoln's death, we are still going through these kind of atrocities. A hangman's noose and a Confederate flag?' neighbor Mary Greer toldWXYZ. Another local complained that at least one of the nooses was hung from a tree small enough for a young child to climb. When the local TV network attempted to speak to Tomanovich on Friday he refused, although his wife Lindy tried to explain the noose as a tribute to a dead friend. 'Robert has a friend that died in that way (hanging himself), and that's in memory of his friend,' she told WXYZ. 'There's no crime in hanging a noose.' An unnamed employee was qick to take credit for the noose at Tomanovich's business. 'Screw 'em... We're gonna put more up,' he said. Tomanovich, 55, has denied his actions are racist and said he simply liked the colors of the Confederate flag, but has since taken it down . Wife Lindy told local media that the noose was a tribute to a friend of her husband who had hung himself . On Monday, Tomanovich spoke to the Daily News and said accusations of racism were 'stupid.' 'I know black guys, I have black friends. We're all laughing at this stupidity. Do you know how many white guys were hung back in the day? This isn't racist. But all of a sudden it's out of control.' He said he had put up the Confederate flag because 'I like the colors'. Tomanovich also said he has since taken down the nooses and flags, but refused to apologize. 'I don't need to defend this to nobody. My business is doing very well,' he said. 'I only want this story to get bigger. I want people to know I'm not a racist.'

7328,"Ever since the iPhone 3GS launched in 2009, Apple has followed a new handset one year with a marginally-different 'S' version the year after. But rumours suggest it is about to abandon these plans by skipping the launch of a 6S this autumn in favour of going straight for the iPhone 7. This difference may seem slight, but it suggests the next model of iPhone could be substantial improvement on iPhone 6 range, and rumours have hinted towards new features such as Force Touch. Rumours suggest Apple is about to abandon the 6S later this year in favour of going straight for the iPhone 7. This difference may seem slight but it suggests the next model of iPhone could be substantial improvement on iPhone 6 range (pictured), and rumours have hinted towards new features . The claims were made by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo during a note to investors on Tuesday, reports MacRumors. He said the next-generation iPhone will feature Force Touch, recently added to the Apple Watch and new MacBook. Apple describes Force Touch as the 'most significant new sensing capability' since Multi‑Touch. It recognises typical scrolling and pinching gestures, but it additionally tracks the pressure of a person's click and responds accordingly. The claims were made by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who said the next-generation iPhone will feature Force Touch, recently added to the Apple Watch and new MacBook (pictured). It recognises typical scrolling and pinching gestures, but additionally tracks the pressure of a click and responds accordingly . Apple released its iOS 8.3 update yesterday. And in addition to 300 new emojis, including the much-anticipated 'racially diverse' people icons, Apple also rolled out Wi-Fi Calling on more networks. People on Sprint in the US and EE in the UK can now use their iPhones to make calls using the web. Wi-Fi Calling routes calls through a Wi-Fi network instead of using mobile signal, which can be notoriously temperamental. Calls made over Wi-Fi don't use minutes or data and can be used to make free calls when roaming. Apple added the option in iOS 8 in September, although it was only used by T-Mobile at that time. EE launched the UK's first Wi-Fi Calling service earlier this week on the Lumia 640 and Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Although services such as Skype and Viber offer calls over Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Calling doesn't require an app and uses the handset's built-in dialler and contact list. This means gestures and tracking feel more intuitive and are more responsive. And on the Watch this feature is used to access more options in menus, for example. If Force Touch is added to the next iPhone, Mr Kuo said the change will be significant enough to warrant Apple adding the 7 moniker to any new handsets. This follows recent rumours which suggested a 4-inch version of the iPhone 6 is in development to replace the iPhone 5C with a lower cost and 'female friendly' design. The handset will be launched during 2015, according to Chinese rumour site Feng.com, and it would complement the current range of larger 4.7 and 5.5-inch screen sizes. In particular, The Feng.com report called the new design  'female friendly', alluding to the fact women typically have smaller hands than men. This could be known as the iPhone 6C, or based on Mr Kuo's predictions, the iPhone 7C. The larger handsets were extremely well received and became Apple's fastest-selling product to date, selling more than 10 million units within the first three days. Many doubted how successful a large screen iPhone would be, claiming it was too big but the recent sales figures show the 6 Plus is outselling every other 'phablet' in the US. Despite being on the market for just a single month of the three months ending October 2014, the iPhone 6 Plus captured 41 per cent of 'phablet' sales.

538,"Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. The SNP demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds - as the latest price of propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street in the event of a hung Parliament. Miss Sturgeon said the rising retirement age was particularly unfair for pensioners in Scotland because they don’t live as long as their counterparts in the rest of the country. Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. She is pictured at the Westerton Care Home during an election campaign visit in Glasgow . The SNP leader demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds . At the same time, she issued a demand for a huge inflation-busting increase in the State pension, which would cost billions of pounds more. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113. Parts of Scotland have among the lowest life expectancies of any part of the UK. In central Glasgow it is less than 73 years for men and for women less than 79. Across Scotland the figure is about 76 for men and 80 for women. In England and Wales the figures are nearly 79 for men and nearly 83 for women. But various studies have linked lower life expectancy in Scotland to higher rates of alcohol consumption, smoking, and poor diet. It is also linked to levels of poverty and housing. Her comments will raise concerns that the SNP will demand a more expensive pension system across the whole of the UK which will benefit Scotland most. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113 . Speaking on a visit to a care home in East Dunbartonshire, Miss Sturgeon said: ‘The Tory/Lib Dem government’s plan to further increase the state pension age is a worry to people across the UK who are planning for their future, but the failure to take Scotland’s specific circumstances into account is particularly unfair. ‘Our comparatively low life expectancy rate is an issue which I will do everything in my power to change but in the meantime it would be completely unacceptable for people in Scotland who have paid in to a state pension all of their lives to lose out.’ ‘That is why SNP MPs will reject any plans for a further increase in the state pension age.’ ‘Our pensioners have contributed hugely to society and are entitled to get a fair deal in their retirement in return. She said the SNP would ensure that ‘the contribution older people have made throughout their lives is recognised’ if they hold the balance of power after the election. Miss Sturgeon also issued a demand for the single tier pension to increase to at least ‘to ensure pensioners are no longer subjected to the scourge of means-tested benefits.’ The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped . A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘Capping the state pension age in Scotland will cost hardworking taxpayers across Britain more than £12.5 billion. ‘This gives another glimpse into a future with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, in the SNP’s pocket – meaning more borrowing, more spending, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ On Sunday Miss Sturgeon said the SNP would be prepared to prop up a minority Labour government even if Ed Miliband lost the election. She said the party’s MPs would vote to support Labour even if the party won fewer seats than the Conservatives on May 7. The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped. For many years, the UK state pension age for men was 65 and the state pension age for women was 60. But from 2020, both men and women’s retirement age will be 66, increasing to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and then linked to life expectancy after that. The government will then review the state pension age every five years. During last year’s referendum campaign, the SNP argued the level should only increase to 66 in Scotland, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £10,000 and £11,000 less.","SNP said retirement age should be frozen, in a move costing billions .

'I'm sorry?' Mr Clarke asked. 'How many do we sell a day? 'You sell a very small number,' Ms Milne responded. Mr Clarke also rejected allegations recently published by Fairfax Media alleging $4.5 billion had been siphoned from Mr Murdoch's Australian operations to the United States virtually tax free. He told the hearing the report was 'hopelessly wrong', arguing the stories were 'either deliberately misleading or no idea; looking at the author (business correspondent Michael West), I would say both'. In her questioning, Ms Milne also alleged The Australian was run for ideological purposes. Mr Clarke, who argued the paper examined policy, accepted her contention. It has been previously reported that the national broadsheet lost $30 million in the 2012/13 financial year. The paper was reportedly hoping to half that loss in the 2013/14 financial year.

5209,"A Canadian woman whose son died fighting for the Islamic State is now working to stop the extremist group from taking advantage of more vulnerable young men and women in North America. Christianne Boudreau thought her son Damien Clairmont was going to Egypt to study Arabic in 2013, but Canadian authorities later told the Calgary mother that her son had instead gone to Turkey where he crossed the border into Syria to join ISIS. While Damien had become more extreme in his Islamic ideology before he left Canada, Ms Boudreau never imagined her shy and peaceful son would actually become a jihadi. 'I thought it was just a phase he was going through,' Ms Boudreau told NBC News. Scroll down for video . A mother's grief: Christianne Boudreau of Calgary, Canada lost her son last year when he was killed fighting for ISIS in Syria . Helping others: The Canadian mother is now working with other families worried about their radicalized children. Boudreau pictured above (left) with her son Damien Clairmont, right . Ms Boudreau is now dealing with the loss of her son by channeling her grief into work - helping families like hers from losing their radicalized children to the extremist group. Ms Boudreau says she raised her son Damien in a Catholic household, but he converted to Islam at the age of 17 while he was having a hard time in high school. Damien was severely bullied, and even considered suicide during this painful period, his mother revealed. So Ms Boudreau was more relieved than worried when he found solace in Islam and started becoming more social again. Helping to deal: Ms Boudreau says her son Damien was bullied in high school and turned to Islam for solace in 17 . Radicalization: However, Ms Boudreau says her son's interested in the religion took a turn in 2011 when he started growing his beard out and distancing himself from the family . 'I saw some positive changes start to happen,' Ms Boudreau told CNN in February. 'He became social again. The old Damian that I knew when he was younger, much younger, was starting to come out.' But Ms Boudreau says her son's interest in Islam took a turn in 2011 when he started distancing himself from the family, growing his beard out and refusing to sit at the dinner table when they were drinking wine. She believes someone in Calgary started radicalizing her son - a process that continued when he searched extremist materials online. Ms Boudreau believes ISIS manipulated her vulnerable son into wanting to join their jihad by appealing to his protective nature. 'I think they got into his head believing that he was saving women and children, and he was very passionate about women and children and felt that they were easy targets,' Ms Boudreau said. Telling his family that he was going to Egypt to study Arabic, Damien left home in November 2012 and traveled to Istanbul where he attended a training camp and eventually crossed the border into war-torn Syria. Ms Boudreau found out about her son's death in January 2014, when a journalist called trying to confirm his death which was published online. He was 22. When Ms Boudreau reached out to the fighter who tweeted a eulogy for her son, he wrote an open letter to her online, saying she should be proud of her son and join ISIS in his memory. When asked what she feels about her son's decision to join ISIS, Ms Boudreau says: 'I'm proud of who he was, I'm proud of what his heart was truly. I'm not proud of the choices he made.' Ms Boudreau says that at the time she lost her son to ISIS, there weren't many organizations she could turn for support about her son. Ms Boudreau is now changing that by working with the families of radicalized young men and women, in an attempt to stop the spread of more homegrown terrorism. 'I can't let Damien die in vain,' Ms Boudreau said.

1753,"Sergio Garcia insists he is focused on winning his first PGA Tour title since 2012 at this week's Shell Houston Open, despite the Masters being just around the corner. Rory McIlroy's bid for a third major victory in succession to complete the career grand slam, plus the question of whether Tiger Woods will end his self-imposed exile from the game, have dominated the agenda for weeks. But, although the Golf Club of Houston is set up to try to replicate some of the conditions the players will face at Augusta, Garcia is concentrating on ending his victory drought. Sergio Garcia lines up a putt during the Cadillac Championship in Doral, Florida last month . The 35-year-old, who finished third 12 months ago but went on to miss the cut at Augusta, told a pre-tournament press conference: 'I think that every single week it's a new story and some weeks you play terrible and then the next week you play amazing. 'Some weeks you play great and the next week you play terrible and some weeks I play great and then you play great. You never know what's going to come out. Obviously you hope and you wish that you play as best as you can. 'I think that there's no doubt that obviously the Masters is in the back of our minds, but I'm here to play well, to get in some good rhythm, to have a chance at winning this week and then as soon as Sunday finishes then I'll concentrate on the Masters. Garcia hits his approach from the fairway at the TPC Blue Monster Course last month . 'I'm not going to be on the golf course this week thinking maybe let's try this shot because I'll have it next week on the 12th or on the 15th or something like that. No. I'm going to be focused on what I want to achieve here and then when Sunday finishes then I can concentrate on next week. 'I felt really comfortable here when I came last year. I wanted to try it again this year and hopefully I'll do better next week, too.' Spaniard Garcia plays out of the trees by the 11th hole at Augusta during the Masters in 2013 . Garcia is also comfortable with the fact that he may never win a major after coming close yet again in the Open last year, finishing second behind McIlroy at Hoylake. 'If it comes down to me not winning any majors when I'm done with my golfing career, I'm not going to be sad,' he added. 'It's not the main thing. Obviously it's something nice to have, and if I get it I'm not going to give it back, but it's not the main thing in my life. 'I think as you get older, as you get more and more experience, you realize the important things in life. I'm not saying that winning a major is not important, but it's not the most important thing in the world. I think there's a lot of other things that you can do that can not only fulfil you as a player, but also as a person.' Garcia (left) stands beside Rickie Fowler with their runner-up trophies at last year's Open at Hoylake . Garcia and Texas native Jordan Spieth are the only players in the world's top 10 left in the field after the withdrawals of Henrik Stenson and Jimmy Walker. World number two Stenson has the flu and cancelled a trip to Augusta, while Walker headed to Augusta after winning the Valero Texas Open but was taken ill and joined Stenson in pulling out.

9969,"Dundee boss Paul Hartley has warned that Paul McGowan may not feature in any of the team's remaining six games this season because he fears playing the troubled midfielder could see him break his police curfew and end up in prison. After his third conviction last week for assaulting a police officer, McGowan escaped a jail sentence but was placed under a restriction of liberty order and confined to his home from 7pm to 7am for 16 weeks. That has already ruled him out of the evening matches with Celtic at Dens Park on Wednesday and at Parkhead on Friday May 1, but Hartley fears that even playing in the three remaining games in the City of Discovery, which kick off at 3pm, could leave the player at risk of breaching his order. Dundee rogue Paul McGowan has been handed his third conviction after assaulting a police officer . Dundee manager Paul Hartley says he will not risk playing the troubled midfielder again this season . Hartley is worried that if McGowan was, for example, called up for after-match drug testing, required hospital treatment for an injury or was caught in traffic on the 80-mile journey back to his home in Coatbridge, he would run perilously close to his 7pm curfew. And he admits the only game in which McGowan would be able to safely feature is the final-day derby at Tannadice which kicks off at 12.30pm on May 24, but even then he may not be risked. 'Paul McGowan is available for selection but there is no guarantee he will play,' conceded Hartley yesterday. 'He has a curfew and we don't want him to break it. 'This is something I will need to look at between now and the end of the season. And we need to look at all aspects of this - where he is playing, what time he will leave after the match, travelling times and whether he gets an injury. 'There are all sorts of things that could happen. Heavy traffic, or his car could break down, or he could be called in for drug testing - which can often take a long time. 'Paul stays in the central belt so there are times when the journey could take longer than an hour and a half. And the last thing we want to see is Paul getting into trouble because he misses his time zone. 'The last game of the season is definitely one he can play in because of the early kick off. We've not asked (the courts) for any special dispensation. But it's something we might look at.' McGowan has been fitted with an electronic tag on his ankle and, if selected by Hartley, it's understood the match-day referee would need to inspect the device before each game to ensure there are no health and safety risks. Law 4 in the Laws of the Game states: 'A player must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous to himself or another player (including any kind of jewellery).' Hartley said: 'There's been a suggestion that he can't play with the current tag he has got but I am sure he could. I've seen it happen before in English football and it's something we've been looking into. We are just waiting for confirmation.' Meanwhile, Dundee have agreed a pre-contract to sign Aberdeen midfielder Nicky Low on a three-year deal. The 23-year-old had been a peripheral figure at Pittodrie. Dons boss Derek McInnes told the Aberdeen official website: 'The option to sign an extended contract with a fellow Premiership club was one which Nicky felt he couldn't turn down.'

9386,"It's a mark of popularity most politicians would give their right arm for – and proof that should Boris Johnson ever run for Tory leader, he has the female vote. The London Mayor was given a big kiss on his right cheek by a particularly enthusiastic voter yesterday as he helped colleagues campaign in Ramsgate. And as he got in his car later, he was spotted with red lipstick marks on his other cheek. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson received such a positive welcome in Ramsgate he was driven away with a lipstick mark on his cheek . Mr Johnson recieves an ethusiastic kiss - as female support for the Tory Mayor shows no sign of abating . Two young women take a selfie with Mr Johnson as he campaigned through London yesterday . Mr Johnson poses for yet another selfie with a young fan, before he took to the streets of Ramsgate, Kent . Boris Johnson yesterday fronted a major Tory push into Nigel Farage's backyard as he was mobbed – and kissed – by fans in the seat where the Ukip leader hopes to become an MP. The London Mayor took to the streets of Ramsgate, boasting that the polls were turning in the Tories' favour. After touring shops and eating icecreams, Mr Johnson said he 'profoundly and passionately' hopes to stop Mr Farage from winning the target seat of South Thanet. Mr Farage has vowed to quit as Ukip leader if he fails to win the seat, where the Tories are defending a majority of 7,600. After some polls suggested that he could struggle, Ukip has stepped up its resources in the Kent seat. But the Tories hope to appeal to people supporting other parties who want to stop Ukip that they 'can vote for us and cut the head off the snake'. On his walkabout yesterday, Mr Johnson insisted voters knew that only the Tories can secure the recovery: 'There is a real risk other parties could mistakenly persuade people there was any other option.' With Tory Craig Mackinlay at his side, Mr Johnson ate icecream in Tory party blue, chatted to locals sitting outside pubs and handed out leaflets. As he was driven away from the seat, he was pictured with a lipstick mark on his cheek. Mr Mackinlay, a former Ukip deputy leader, is locked in a tight fight with Mr Farage, with Labour's Will Scobie close behind. Mr Johnson yesterday joined Tory Craig Mackinlay, who is defending a Conservative majority of around 7,600 in the South Thanet seat . The pair ate Tory blue icecreams at at Sorbetta as they toured shops and businesses in Ramsgate, with Mr Johnson boasting that the polls are turning in the Conservatives' favour . Mr Johnson was met by the usual mob of journalists and turned heads as he walked down the main street toward's the Kent town's harbour. But the mayor - who is running his own campaign to enter Parliament as MP for Uxbridge - also drew placard-waving Ukip supporters. The high profile Conservative was not universally welcomed and was questioned by one person on why the Tories only started paying attention to the seat once Mr Farage announced he was running. Another asked Mr Johnson if he himself would vote Ukip, while the eurosceptic party ensured two of its ad vans followed the group around the town. During his visit, Mr Johnson chatted to people enjoying a drink outside in the bright sunshine at The Royal pub, visited the Rokka cafe and sampled bright blue bubblegum flavour ice cream at Sorbetta. On his walkabout yesterday, Mr Johnson insisted voters knew that only the Tories can secure the recovery . Mr Johnson denied his rare campaign stop outside the capital was an attempt to revitalise a Tory campaign criticised by some for being too negative . Mr Johnson repeatedly told passersby he and Mr Mackinlay were campaigning for 'regeneration for Ramsgate' Speaking to journalists, Mr Johnson denied his rare campaign stop outside the capital was an attempt to revitalise a Tory campaign criticised by some for being too negative. He said: 'I think that on the contrary if you look at the polls at the minute it's very, very interesting. 'You are starting to see some Tory leads but also the poll of polls is starting to put us ahead on average. 'Last week I think we were a point or so behind on average and this week we're ahead. 'I think people are slowly starting to focus on this election, on the choice that is before them and on the record of Conservative government in pulling the economy out of the mire, getting it back on the road. 'There is a real risk other parties could mistakenly persuade people there was any other option.' There was a lot of love for the Mayor when he later visited Finchley in north London . Mr Johnson, who repeatedly told passersby he and Mr Mackinlay were campaigning for 'regeneration for Ramsgate', said he was eager to see the former Ukip leader join the Tory ranks in Parliament. Constituency polling has suggested Mr Mackinlay, who was a founding member of Ukip and contested seats for the party at past general elections, is narrowly ahead of Mr Farage. The Ukip leader has waged his own high profile campaign in the constituency, which was won by the Conservatives on a narrow majority in 2010. Mr Johnson said his campaign would continue to be focused on London, suggesting he would not hit the national campaign trail. He said: 'Unless I specifically tell you otherwise, I am pounding the streets of London every day.' Mr Johnson attracted a lot of admirers as he met supporters in the Kent sunshine yesterday .","London Mayor receives kiss from a female fan and is left with lipstick mark .

6423,"A controversial US pastor has defended trying to buy a $65million private jet with worshippers' donations and responded to critics by claiming 'the devil is trying to discredit' him. Reverend Creflo Dollar, 53, launched an appeal last month for 200,000 people to each donate '$300 or more' so that he could purchase a Gulfstream G650 to replace his current damaged aircraft. The wealthy televangelist, who is known to own two Rolls Royces and multi-million dollar homes, came under heavy criticism for the appeal but has insisted he needs the plane for preaching work. Scroll down for video . Defends private jet appeal: Reverend Creflo Dollar has defended trying to buy a $65million Gulfstream G650 with worshippers' donations by claiming 'the devil is trying to discredit' him . The appeal: This notice was posted on the church's website, pleading for donations so that Dollar could 'continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ'. It has since been taken down . Dollar, who is one of the most prominent African-American preachers in the United States, launched the private jet appeal via a five-minute video on his website. Shortly afterwards, he shut the website down but worshippers could still donate to the cause via the World Changers donation site which remains open. In a newly posted five-minute clip on YouTube, the Atlanta-based pastor responded to his critics saying: '(The devil thinks) I got to discredit that man before he starts showing people Jesus! 'I'm on my sabbatical, and the enemy's trying to discredit me. I never one time came to you and asked you for a dime for this airplane, did I? Damaged: Dollar says the church's current plane, bought in 1999, is broken and needs to be replaced, or he will be unable to continue working around the world . 'The (critics) don't know what we do. That's why they asked the question, what does a preacher need with an airplane? If you knew what we did, then you wouldn't ask that question. 'Just because the world doesn't have it, doesn't mean that you can't.' Dollar is the head of the World Changers Church International, a Christian ministry centered around the prosperity gospel, which preaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches. His original appeal for the Gulfstream G650 - which claims to be the fastest plane ever built in civilian aviation - was so that 'World Changers Church International can continue to blanket the globe with the Gospel of grace'. A Gulfstream G650 can fly 18 passengers and four crew members, according to gulfstream.com. The jet comes with two Rolls-Royce engines, high-speed Internet and two multichannel satellites and allows for a four-and-a-half-hour commute from New York to Los Angeles. 'The G650 is the biggest, fastest, most luxurious, longest range and most technologically advanced jet -- by far,' according to the site. Among the billionaires who own a Gulfstream G650 are Steve Jobs' wife Lauren Powell Jobs, Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn add Nike co-founder Phil Knight. There is a long waiting list for the aircraft, with the next round of planes not due until 2017. Couple: Dollar and his wife, Taffi (pictured together) were married in 1985 and have five children . Wealthy: Dollar and his family primarily live in this multi-million dollar in Fayettville, Georgia, south of Atlanta . According to the Creflo Dollar Ministry's website: 'The ministry's current airplane, was built in 1984, purchased by the ministry in 1999 and has since logged four million miles. 'Recently on an overseas trip to a global conference, one of the engines failed. 'By the grace of God, the expert pilot, who's flown with Creflo for almost 20 years, landed the plane safely without injury or harm to any passengers.' The Christian Post first reported that Dollar insisted that he needs the jet to continue sharing the word of Jesus. He preaches all over the world, but primarily works out of a 8,500-seat amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome', sending the sermons to churches all over the country via satellite. The website pledge continued: 'Believe it or not, there are still millions of people on this planet who have never heard of Jesus Christ and know nothing of His greatness.' Arrested: The Reverend was charged in 2012 for allegedly attacking his teenage daughter . 'Our hearts desire to see precious lives changed and snatched out of darkness and thrust into His marvelous light! 'We need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ,"" the appeal continued before asking supporters of the ministry to sow a $300 seed into the airplane fund, billed Project G650.' According to Financial Juneteenth, a Report of the Senate Finance Committee, Minority Staff Review of WCCI, found that Dollar's current jet had also been used for a variety of vacation flights, including stops in Las Vegas, Nevada, Miami, Florida and Hawaii, citing Federal Aviation Administration figures. Dollar has refused over the years to disclose his salary, but has an estimated net worth of $27 million. He has five children to his wife, Taffi, who he married in 1985. In June 2012, his 15-year-old daughter called 911, saying her father repeatedly punched and choked her at their Atlanta home. The teenager also said it wasn't the first time something like that had happened and that she felt threatened living in the house. Dollar was arrested and charged with family brutality and juvenile cruelty. The charges were later dropped, but he was required to complete a three-month anger management program. At his next sermon, two days following the arrest, Dollar spent several minutes addressing the incident, starting with: 'I will say this emphatically: I should have never been arrested.' Dollar has strenuously denied the accusations, saying it was a family argument with 'heightened emotions'. The goal: Dollar wants a $65million Gulfstream G650 business jet, a plane favored by billionaires that bills itself as the fastest plane built in civil aviation . Influential: Dollar is the head of the World Changers Church International, a Christian ministry centered around the prosperity gospel, which preaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches . Dollar's wife Taffi has been known to introduce her husband at his sermons. During her address, she claims Dollar comes 'face to face with God, like Moses'. She also includes an admonition saying that 'every tongue that rises up against' (Dollar) 'will be struck down', Financial Juneteenth reported. The World Changers Church International (WCCI) has about 30,000 constituents.","In March Atlanta-based Reverend Creflo Dollar launched private jet appeal .

'Molly' is the name given to the powder or crystallized form of MDMA, the drug compound also found in ecstasy. After being patted down, Stoll was asked whether the powder in the pink baggie was cocaine and answered yes, according to the police report.

Friday was the two-year anniversary of MGM Grand's popular club Hakkasan, an event featuring Tiesto that brought out names like Christina Aguilera. In both 2012 and 2014 Stoll headed to the MGM Grand to celebrate at the end of the hockey season. It seems that Stoll went on a date with Andrews on Thursday night, as she posted a photo of a romantic-looking candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page, and a fan snapped a photo with Stoll earlier in the day. The caption, which did not mention Stoll by name, read: 'Always a great date night.' The popular television personality recently spoke about her boyfriend while participating in the Grub Street Diet, a weekly feature in which celebrities keep a diary of what they eat for the week.

4417,"The Ukip candidate exposed by The Mail on Sunday after calling for all immigrants to be sent home is at the centre of a row over claims she falsely said her son was injured in Afghanistan. Victoria Ayling, who is running for the key election seat of Great Grimsby, made the comments after being confronted by her local party over her non-attendance at Ukip meetings. After saying it was because she had spent ‘five months nursing her son back to health after being blown up in Afghanistan’, Lieutenant Colonel Ron Shepherd, the leader of Ukip’s North East Lincolnshire group, launched an investigation. Scroll down for video . Row: UKIP politician Victoria Ayling, with party leader Nigel Farage, who is being questioned over claims about son . Astonishingly, he has raised questions about whether she has misrepresented her son’s situation. Mrs Ayling denies that is the case. It is the latest controversy to hit the 55-year-old, who in 2013 was caught on camera calling for all immigrants to be repatriated, saying: ‘I just want to send the lot back.’ She claimed her remarks had been taken ‘out of context’. Mrs Ayling fought Great Grimsby at the 2010 Election as a Tory, coming within 714 votes of a shock victory against Labour veteran Austin Mitchell, who is now standing down. The seat is high on Ukip leader Nigel Farage’s hitlist. Controversy: Victoria Ayling on front page of Mail on Sunday . Lieut-Col Shepherd set out his findings in a memo dated Monday December 8, which read: ‘I understand her son Anthony Bowles is stationed in Woolwich as part of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment. I have spoken with the Adjutant of 1 RA who cannot release details to me. Anthony’s grandmother Brenda has stated he’s not been blown up.’ Shortly afterwards, Mrs Ayling was confronted by local Ukip councillor Matt Stinson about whether her son had been injured. The incident took place at a meeting attended by David Soutter, whose job is to vet Ukip candidates. Mrs Ayling fought back, saying: ‘It is a private matter and nothing to do with you, Matt. My son had problems in Afghanistan and is recovered and back in service. ‘If anybody in the Army is giving out mistruths or anything about my son I want to know their name – they have got no right to talk about another soldier’s private life.’ Last night, this newspaper was called anonymously by a man who said he was a soldier who had served alongside Mr Bowles. The unidentified caller said Ukip’s Grimsby party had been unfair to Mrs Ayling – because she had kept the matter quiet to protect her son. He added Mr Bowles had been caught up in a ‘very bad situation’, which he declined to describe. Lieut-Col Shepherd said last night: ‘You’ll have to talk to Victoria about that.’ Mrs Ayling said: ‘This is a private matter.’ The MoD declined to comment.","Victoria Ayling said she spent five months nursing son back to health .

7106,"The old adage may claim that a liar can not look you in the eye, but in truth liars often stare. That's according to former police officer, Darren Stanton, who has become the UK's top human leading human lie detector and body expert. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, the former police officer who has a background in psychology, micro expression training, and neuro linguistic programming (the study of body signals), showed his immense skill in sniffing out deceit. Scroll down for video . The old adage may claim that a liar can not look you in the eye, but in truth liars often stare . Darren Stanton, who has become the UK's top human leading human lie detector and body expert, appeared on This Morning . He managed to suss out when both Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden were were fibbing and also appeared in a video clip catching out a cheating husband for lying about an affair. He asked Amanda Holden to conceal a ball and then try and trick him about which hand it was in, but Darren managed to spot her fib straight away. 'I noticed a slight flick on that side of the mouth – a micro expression,' he said, much to the presenters amazement. Philip Schofield was also caught fibbing, which Darren said he detected by a raised eyebrow. The full-time human lie detector, who recently sat in on the phone hacking trial, then shared his secrets on the This Morning website. How do you tell if someone is telling porkies? 'People might clutch a clipboard, file or coffee cup to their chest, creating a subconscious barrier if they're lying,' he says. 'Or hold it in two hands. Darren knew presenter Amanda Holden was fibbing due to a slight flick on one side of the mouth, much to the presenters amazement. 'Statistically it's a myth that a liar can't look you in the eye. Three to five seconds of eye contact is normal. Any longer and they are either in love with you or fibbing. He also said that brief answers and hesitation are also signs of lying. 'Liars don't like being asked for details. If they're not prepared, they'll either mirror your language or stutter for an answer,' he explains. 'The greater the consequences, the more signals a liar gives off,' adds, giving the example that a person who has committed a serious fraud would give more signals than someone who has stolen a cream cake. But according to the lie-sniffing expert people often have an accurate gut instinct about whether those close to them are telling the truth or not. 'The difference is that the techniques I've learned accelerate this process so I can have the same level of rapport and insight with another in seconds,' he explains. But one of the easiest ways to spot a liar is spotting a twitch. Liars often twitch when they are being untruthful,' he says. 'Sometimes it can be a particularly long blink, or it could be a tiny muscle in the cheek or neck. Men in particular have an area at the bottom of their nose that twitches when they are fibbing.'

The teenager took to social media after Welbeck scored the winner to knock his former club Manchester United out of the FA Cup on March 9. He posted a vile, racist rant under the username @angeIsleftfoot which read: 'Welbeck is dead to me, the f****** c***…’ Danny Welbeck scored the winner as Arsenal beat Manchester United in the FA Cup quarter-final in March . The tweet, posted after Welbeck's decisive role in Arsenal's victory at Old Trafford, continued with sickening references that are too offensive to publish here.

9021,"(CNN)The NFL draft begins on April 30, and while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are on the clock with the No. 1 overall pick, the clock is still ticking for another team -- the New England Patriots -- as they await the results of the ""Deflategate"" investigation, which has already lasted more than three months. In January, the NFL launched an investigation into the Patriots to determine why 11 of the 12 game balls they provided for the AFC Championship game were underinflated. The league hired attorney Ted Wells -- who also investigated the Miami Dolphins bullying scandal -- to run the investigation. Jeff Pash, the NFL's executive vice president and chief counsel, is assisting Wells in the effort. The league has also retained Renaissance Associates, an investigatory firm with sophisticated forensic expertise, to assist in reviewing electronic and video information. But three months later, it's still not clear when the investigation will be completed and when the findings will be announced. ""We have not put a time frame on Ted Wells,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said March 25. ""We asked him to be thorough, complete and when he is finished with that -- he'll give that to us and to the public in general."" On Monday, CNN reached out to Wells and the NFL for an update on the investigation but has not heard back. On January 18, the Patriots beat the Indianapolis Colts 45-7 to advance to the Super Bowl. They scored 28 of their points in the second half -- after game officials had pumped the balls back up to their regulation pressure -- so it's unlikely that the ball pressure made much difference in the outcome of the game. In February, Colts General Manager Ryan Grigson said at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis that prior to the AFC Championship game, his team notified the league of its concerns about the footballs. ""We went into the game, we had some issues, but we are going to do what we can and that's to participate with the league and the investigation and wait until the Wells report comes out,"" Grigson said February 19. ""We really have no other recourse than to wait until that investigation comes out."" Each team provides a dozen footballs to the referee for testing two hours and 15 minutes before kickoff. The home team also supplies 12 backup balls, and for outdoor games, the visiting team has the option of bringing another 12 balls. NFL rules state the referee ""shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications. A pump is to be furnished by the home club, and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the Referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game."" The ball attendant brings the footballs to the field, and ball boys keep them on the sideline. It's been speculated that deflated footballs are easier to grip for the quarterback and receivers. However, there isn't a consensus by players on that view. The day after the AFC Championship game, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady called the accusation of using deflated footballs ""ridiculous."" A few days later, he told reporters he has always played by the rules. Following a practice on January 24, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said that the Patriots try to do everything right. ""At no time was there any intent whatsoever to try to compromise the integrity of the game or to gain an advantage,"" Belichick said at the time. ""Quite the opposite, we feel like we follow the rules of the game to the letter in our preparations, in our procedures."" After arriving in Arizona for Super Bowl XLIX, Patriots owner Robert Kraft said he expects the NFL to apologize if the investigation does not uncover any wrongdoing. ""Many jump to conclusions and made strong accusations against our coach, quarterback, and staff questioning the integrity of all involved,"" Kraft said then. ""If the Wells investigation is not able to definitely determine that our organization tampered with the air pressure in the footballs, I would expect and hope the league would apologize to our entire team and in particular coach Belichick and Tom Brady for what they have had to endure this past week."" In terms of punishment, the Patriots could be fined and/or docked a draft pick. After Spygate in 2007 -- where the Patriots illegally videotaped the New York Jets defensive coaches' signals -- the league took away a Patriots first-round draft pick, fined the team $250,000 and fined Belichick $500,000. However, it's not expected that the punishment would be that serious for Deflategate. In March, two other teams were punished by the NFL for different rules violations. Cleveland Browns General Manager Ryan Farmer admitted to using his phone to text the Browns staffers during games during the 2014 season. It's against the rules to use certain electronic devices during games. Farmer will be suspended without pay for the first four regular-season games of the 2015 season, and the Browns were fined $250,000. During the suspension, Farmer cannot be involved in any team matters and is prohibited from being at the Browns' offices, practice facility or at Browns games. According to the league, there was no evidence in the NFL's review that Browns ownership or any other team executives had knowledge of the prohibited conduct. The Atlanta Falcons acknowledged the use of prerecorded crowd noise, which is also a violation of NFL rules, during home games in the 2013 and into the 2014 season. The rule states that ""at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium."" The Falcons were fined $350,000 and lose their fifth-round draft pick in the 2016 NFL draft. The league's investigation found that the Falcons' former director of event marketing was directly responsible, but that senior executives, including team president Rich McKay, were unaware of the use of the piped-in crowd noise. Still, McKay was suspended from the NFL Competition Committee starting April 1. Starting June 30, he can petition Goodell for reinstatement to the committee. As to what happens to the Patriots, and when, it's still anyone's guess. But Goodell has previously stated that a violation of rules will be taken seriously. ""Whenever there is a charge potentially of the violations of our  rules, we take it very seriously and that's our obligation,"" Goodell said in March. ""That's our obligation to the other 31 clubs. Ted Wells will be going through the report. If there is anything that we as a league did incorrectly we will know about it in that report."" What the heck is Deflategate?","NFL investigating why game balls provided by New England Patriots for championship game were underinflated .

1306,"(CNN)One of the biggest TV events of all time is being reimagined for new audiences. ""Roots,"" the epic miniseries about an African-American slave and his descendants, had a staggering audience of over 100 million viewers back in 1977. Now A&E networks are remaking the miniseries, to air in 2016. A&E, Lifetime and History (formerly the History Channel) announced Thursday that the three networks would simulcast a remake of the saga of Kunta Kinte, an African who was captured, shipped to America and sold into slavery to work on a Virginia plantation. LeVar Burton, who portrayed Kinte in the original, will co-executive produce the new miniseries. A press release describes the new version as ""original"" and ""contemporary"" and will draw more from Alex Haley's classic novel, ""Roots: The Saga of an American Family."" Producers will consult scholars in African and African-American history for added authenticity. ""We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original, as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time,"" said Dirk Hoogstra, History's executive vice president and general manager. ""Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte's indomitable spirit."" Executive producer Mark Wolper, son of the original's producer David L. Wolper, added, ""Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage, to Alex Haley, to my father, and now the mantle rests with me. Like Kunta Kinte fought to tell his story over and over again, so must we."" The remade ""Roots"" will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation's first African-American president and ""12 Years a Slave"" win the Oscar for Best Picture, but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities. ""My career began with 'Roots' and I am proud to be a part of this new adaptation,"" said Burton.

The 26-year-old's burned body was found around five metres from a road in Cocoparra National Park, north of Griffith, NSW, on Friday afternoon by police in an area where her accused killer went on regular camping trips. NSW Health says a post-mortem has been completed at Glebe Morgue in Sydney and a report is in the hands of the coroner. 'Additional testing is being undertaken prior to the release of Ms Scott’s body to her family,' a spokeswoman said. The Department of Forensic Medicine has made contact with Ms Scott's family to provide specialist grief counselling. Scroll down for video . The body of Stephanie Scott, pictured with her mother on a wine tour for her hen party last month in Canberra, has been formally identified after an autopsy was carried out this week . The adored teacher from Leeton went missing on Easter Sunday while preparing to go marry her fiancé Aaron Leeson-Woolley (left) On Monday, Ms Scott's devastated father opened up about the grief her family is feeling as they struggle to come to terms with their daughter's brutal murder, which took place just days before her wedding. The adored English and drama teacher disappeared from Leeton, a town in the Riverina region of NSW, approximately 550 km west of Sydney, on Easter Sunday while making final preparations for her honeymoon to Tahiti. Ms Scott's grieving father Robert explained that it is especially painful that Stephanie's life has been taken away when she had so much to look forward to. She was also a person who gave so much joy to others. 'Stephanie's aim was to get everyone feeling like it was their wedding as much as hers,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph, describing Ms Scott's bubbly and thoughtful personality. There are reminders of the wedding all over the house, yet instead of a wedding the Scott family must tragically prepare for Stephanie's funeral. 'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott.

The ceremony was due to go ahead on Saturday April 11 - however cruelly the day before her remains were discovered by police. Ms Scott and Mr Leeson-Woolley had been taking dancing lessons together to prepare for their first dance as an excited married couple, according to Robert. But the moment when Mr Leeson-Woolley should have been holding his new bride during their planned first dance to a Keith Urban song, he was inconsolable at his fiancée's memorial.

She loved her family, drama, soccer and school - eager for every opportunity to learn. It comes after local Leeton parents expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott. Stephanie Scott was a 'favourite teacher' to many students at Leeton High School . A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their children.

Meanwhile Jodie Salerno posted: 'Stephanie was my son and 2 daughters favourite teacher at leeton high this ... has put so much pain and sadness on our comunity [sic].' Ms Salerno told The Australian her three children 'don't want to return' to school because they are so upset over Ms Scott's death. Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday. NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports.

8484,"Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio, although the 18-time Olympic champion won't swim in the world championships this summer. Phelps confirmed his intention to make one last run at the Olympics on Wednesday. 'You guys heard it here first,' he told reporters at Skyline Aquatic Center, where he will be competing in his first meet since serving a six-month suspension by USA Swimming after a second drunken driving arrest last fall. 'I am looking forward to next year. I don't think it's too hard to really realize why I came back.' 18-time Olympic champion Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio . But Phelps said he won't be swimming at the world meet in Russia in August as part of the punishment set forth by the sport's U.S. governing body. He had already qualified in three events before being banned from the last major international meet before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. 'I really enjoy being on those trips,' he said. 'That's why it is painful to think that I won't have the chance to compete at worlds.' There had been informal discussions about Phelps being reinstated to the US team for worlds, but it would have meant removing swimmers that were named to the team in his absence. 'By no means do I want this to be a distraction from the team,' he said. 'No way would I ever want to displace a member of that team.' Phelps in action during a practice session Mesa, Arizona on Wednesday . Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation after being arrested on DUI charges in his hometown of Baltimore last September. He offered no specifics about his treatment, which he continued in Maryland. He also enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous. 'The last couple of months have probably been the hardest I've ever had to go through in my entire life,' he said. 'I take full responsibility for all of my actions. I've hurt a lot of people and it's been terrible.' The 29-year-old swimmer was sentenced to 18 months of probation. He said he's done more growing up in recent months than he has in his entire life. 'I have been able to come out on a better end, have a clear head,' he said. 'I don't think I've ever been like this once in my life.' Phelps' longtime coach, Bob Bowman, acknowledged his star swimmer's second arrest for drunken driving made it 'pretty hard to convince me that anything was going to lead us back to something that we'd be proud of.' Phelps called Bowman a few times from rehab, which the coach described as 'really weird' because he typically never heard from Phelps away from the pool. Bowman visited Phelps during treatment, still skeptical that the swimmer was there for any reason other than he had to be. But Bowman left thinking differently. Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation . 'I just had no doubt that he had changed in a way that was really meaningful,' Bowman said. 'He was completely different and it's been that way every day since he's been back.' Phelps pleaded guilty after his first drunken driving arrest in 2004. Five years later, a photo was published of him using a marijuana pipe at a party, which drew a three-month suspension and caused some sponsors to drop him. Phelps knows not everyone will believe he's contrite and has changed. 'If somebody doesn't believe the words that are coming out of my mouth that's their choice,' he said. 'I, of course, would like to show everybody in the world that I am in a different place and I am much better than I ever have been. I understand that's going to take a lot of time. This week will be the first week that I can start that.' Phelps will be competing in Mesa for the first time since the Pan Pacific Championships last August. The Arizona meet was where Phelps made his comeback a year ago after an extended retirement following the 2012 Olympics. Phelps adjusts North Baltimore Aquatic Center team-mate Allison Schmidt's cap during practice . He isn't sure what to expect, having only recently returned to the kind of hard training he did before the 2008 Beijing Games, where he won a record eight gold medals. Phelps is falling back on the mentality he used for much of his career. 'I would just get up and swim as hard as I could and leave it in the water,' he said. 'That's what I'm going to do here. I know I'm more prepared now than I was at this time last year.' His first event is the 100-meter butterfly on Thursday, when he'll compete against longtime rival Ryan Lochte. Phelps is surrounding himself with familiar faces this week, including his fiancee Nicole Johnson and family members. 'I'm a lot happier and in a lot better state and in a lot better physical shape than I really have been in a long time,' he said.","Michael Phelps is hoping to compete a the 2016 Olympics in Rio .

1545,"(CNN)I remember traveling one day in the local train in Mumbai with my mother, my younger sister and brother. The compartment was extremely crowded. As we prepared to disembark, I felt my skirt being lifted and someone groping my private parts. It was terrible. I wanted to scream, but my voice would have drowned in the noise of the crowd. I wanted to push the hands away, but my arms were pinned to my body. I wanted to cry but could only think to myself, ""Stop it! Please stop touching me."" I was 13 years old. I never told anyone about that day until recently. Twenty-five years later, I continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces. The stories can be stomach churning: men masturbating on buses and at bus stops, boys stalking young girls -- both physically and online, men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the Internet. Then there are just the everyday, uncomfortable stares, frequently accompanied by comments with sexual connotations. This isn't all simply anecdotal. A study by We the People found that 80% of women in Mumbai had been street harassed, primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms. Most people, including women, only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching, groping and stalking, not to mention the ""milder"" forms of ogling, leering, catcalling and whistling, even though all of this can be intimidating. Indeed, many women choose to limit their hours outside, select more conservative clothes, or opt for a longer but safer route home. It was only recently that I realized my phobia of trains likely originated with that bad experience I had as a child. I still avoid trains when I can. Most people are silent when inappropriate sexual behavior occurs to women. It was depressing to hear one young college student tell me in a recent sexual harassment workshop I led that ""staring and commenting by men is normal and I've learned to ignore it."" The reality is that sexual harassment in India is pervasive in all aspects of life. It hits you in the face every day when you walk down the street, take local transport, go about your daily routine or at the workplace. According to U.N. Women's report, 1 in 3 women around the world face some form of sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. This statistic is likely even higher in India. Out of the 2,000 women who have attended workshops I've conducted, only a handful of them have never been at the receiving end of harassment in some setting of their daily lives. Shockingly, less than 10 of them had reported harassment to any official channel. Why are we constantly limiting our options rather than confronting sexual harassment? Over the past two years, I have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in India. It is not always easy speaking up about sexual harassment. I know firsthand. But acknowledging that it is unacceptable is an important first step. India has laws for sexual violence in public spaces as well as at the workplace, and knowing these rules gives women the power to confront her harasser. But is it enough? Women still have to confront the cultural challenge of not feeling ""ashamed"" and bringing ""disrepute"" to their families while overcoming their fear of dealing with the police, who too often file complaints in the wrong categories to reduce the number of official cases on which their performance is judged. However, despite the barriers, two recent cases in India provide proof that even when the perpetrator is in a position of immense power, coming forward to report sexual harassment can make a difference. There is, for example, the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss Rajendra Pachauri made unwelcome advances to her through text messages. Her bold and persistent quest for justice resulted in Pachauri stepping down from his position as chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Pachauri denied the allegations and insisted his computer and phone were hacked. His counsel stated in court that Pachauri's inbox was not hacked, but he had shared the password with several people who could have sent inappropriate emails to the employee under his name. Similarly, last year, Tarun Tejpal, founder of one of India's leading media companies, was arrested for sexually assaulting his employee in an elevator. She first told her female editor who reportedly did not take her seriously.  She then spoke about it to her male colleagues who encouraged her to report the incident to the police. Tarun Tejpal, who explained the incident as a ""bad lapse of judgment,"" was let out on interim bail while the case is still ongoing. Women have allies -- both male and female -- who are willing to help clear the barriers. Women everywhere just need to find the courage to speak up. The alternative to speaking out is a world where women feel less able to live full lives, restricted and disempowered. We cannot accept harassment as part of our daily routine. We cannot ignore it -- for our own sake and the next generation of women.","Women in India are street harassed, primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms .

Trevor Noah was photographed on Monday at Citi Field along with Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David as the New York Mets took on the Philadelphia Phillies during Opening Day . Broadway star Matthew Broderick was also present as the South African comedian came to grips with that most American of pasttimes . Earlier Noah and Seinfeld had been photographed filming a segment for Seinfeld's acclaimed Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee online series. The pair were filmed walking around the DUMBO neighbourhood of Brooklyn and behind the wheel of a white Ferrari. Noah's very public appearance with New York Jewish comedy royalty comes not long after he was accused of anti-Semitism in the wake of his surprise promotion to Daily Show host. Cynics might wonder if Monday's very public appearance with Seinfield and David was a concerted move to combat that negative publicity but alternatively perhaps the comedian is undertaking a crash course in learning about American culture. His successor Stewart had an infamous obsession with the Mets that became a long-running joke on the Daily Show for over a decade. Noah, who is little-known in the US, rocketed to national fame last month after he was named as longtime host Stewart's replacement on the satirical news program. Earlier Noah and Seinfeld had been photographed filming a segment for Seinfeld's acclaimed Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee online series . Noah and Seinfeld were filmed walking around the DUMBO neighbourhood of Brooklyn and behind the wheel of a white Ferrari . However, the excitement surrounding the announcement was tinged by hundreds of internet users accusing the 31-year-old - who is a quarter Jewish - of anti-Semitism for a series of 'offensive' posts. The comedian quickly apologized and told his two million followers: 'To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn't land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian.' It comes as Comedy Central, which hired Noah as a correspondent on the show just three months ago, has defended its newest star as a 'provocative' comedian who 'spares noone, himself included'. In a statement, the network said: 'To judge him or his comedy based on a handful of jokes is unfair.' It added: 'Trevor is a talented comedian with a bright future at Comedy Central.' Noah, the son of a half-Jewish Xhosa mother and a Swiss father, drew fire for jokes that were described as tasteless, hateful, and unfunny. The controversial tweets were posted between 2009 and 2014. In May last year, Noah tweeted: 'Behind every successful Rap Billionaire is a double as rich Jewish man. #BeatsByDreidel.' Noah's very public appearance with New York Jewish comedy royalty comes not long after he was accused of anti-Semitism in the wake of his surprise promotion to Daily Show host . 'Not a true reflection': In a tweet earleir this month, Noah told his two million followers: 'To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn't land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian' A year earlier, he posted: 'Note to self - Langostines are not Jewish prawns.' Meanwhile, during a soccer match in January 2012, he joked: 'Messi gets the ball and the real players try foul him, but Messi doesn't go down easy, just like jewish chicks. #ElClasico.' He also slammed the United States' midsection in a 2013 tweet, writing that 'When flying over the middle of America the turbulence is so bad. It's like all the ignorance is rising through the air.' And in 2009, Noah, who can speak an impressive six languages, wrote: 'Almost bumped a Jewish kid crossing the road. He didn't look b4 crossing but I still would hav felt so bad in my german car!' On Tuesday, the tweets were being posted online by enraged bloggers, who slammed Noah as 'racist'. One said: 'Jon Stewart, born Leibowitz, won't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets.' Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' He promised that Noah 'will earn your trust and respect. Or not. Just as I earned your trust and respect. Or did not.' More seriously, he said if viewers give Noah the chance to prove himself, 'it's going to be well worth it.'","The South African comedian, whose announcement as Jon Stewart's replacement surprized many, was spotted at Citi Field on Monday .

4858,"Rafa Benitez is what he is; an excellent cup manager. He proved this yet again on Thursday, when his Napoli side blitzed past Europa League favourites Wolfsburg by four goals to one on the Germans' home turf. But despite managing some of the continent's most established clubs since leaving Valencia just over a decade ago - Liverpool, Inter, Chelsea (albeit on an interim basis) and Napoli - he has amassed a grand total of zero league titles. Benitez famously guided Liverpool to the Champions League in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes . Benitez remains popular at Anfield, but when he left there were few regrets over his departure . Donovan Chandler is a Liverpool fan writer on 90min.com . At Anfield, we will be eternally grateful for the Champions League trophy he delivered in 2005, in spite of possessing what was, on paper at least, our worst accumulation of players in recent history. Djimi Traore, Antonio Nunez, Milan Baros and Igor Biscan - cult hero that he was - were all part of that unfathomably successful squad. All four were dispensed of either that summer or the one that followed. Two years after Instanbul, Benitez was (almost) at it again with a side that better resembled the one he would have wanted, though it wasn't quite good enough to overcome an improved AC Milan side on this occasion. For all the Spaniard's successes, he also brought in the hapless Djimi Traore and Czech forward Milan Baros . And although we ran Manchester United a close second two seasons after that, we actually ended up further away from the Premier League title than we had been in a number of years during his final campaign (2009-10) - a failure that signalled the end to an Anfield tenure that also yielded our last FA Cup. In between, he lumbered us with the Josemi's, Albert Riera's and Phillipp Degen's of this world; none of us had many regrets over his departure - except, of course, that it was the catalyst for our introduction to Roy Hodgson. Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006 on penalties against West Ham . With Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard playing well together, Benitez got close to the title, but never won it . And for all his moments, I fully believe we are on the right track again under Brendan Rodgers, even if we can't quite clutch that final Champions League spot this season - or miss out on the FA Cup. That's why, if Rafa returns to England again in the summer - as is being speculated due to Napoli's Serie A shortcomings this season - it will receive little more than a shrug from large sections of the Kop. His league failings mean he is unlikely to be sworn in at any of our top-four rivals, unless Manchester City need someone to keep the seat warm for their dream conquest Pep Guardiola. Liverpool's failure in the Premier League means that Benitez will always be remembered as a cup specialist . As far as my uneducated eyes can see, someone like West Ham would be the best place for your money, if you're that way inclined. A sudden influx of largely Spanish-based signings would bring (mostly temporary) excitement and they'd probably do well in the cups - enough to banish memories of the Big Sam years at least. That's where Rafa excels; Europa League success at Stamford Bridge and triumph in the Coppa Italia last term are further testament to this. But a threat to us and where we want to be? It would only be a result of our own self-destruction. Good luck, Rafa. And thanks for the memories.","Rafa Benitez won the Champions League and FA Cup with Liverpool .

10024,"A 33-year-old professional skydiver who has made more than 6,000 dives was killed during a dive in Florida on Wednesday, after her chute apparently collided with another mid-air. Jessica Edgeington, of Villa Rica, Georgia, was a skilled diver known for a type of high-speed sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and sweep over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition. She died after plummeting to the ground at the Skydive DeLand in DeLand, Florida. It is the second death at the skydiving center this year, after Navy SEAL William Marston died after landing heavily in January. It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air. First responders arrived about 4.10pm and Edgeington was pronounced dead at the scene. Tragedy: Jessica Edgeington, 33, a professional skydiver, was killed in a dive on Wednesday in DeLand, Florida, after apparently colliding with another dive mid-air . Professional: Edgeington had made over 6,000 jumps and competed in a sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and swoop over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition . Investigation: It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air, but the crash is under investigation . Scene: Edgeington was pronounced dead at DeLand Municipal Airport on Wednesday about 4.10pm . Local media reports say Edgeington collided with another diver, causing a problem with her parachute. However the crash is currently under investigation. According to The Tampa Bay Times,  'swoopers' like Edgeington jump from the plane at 5,000 feet and reach speeds of 90 miles per hour as they descend. The sport is about how the person can handle their parachute and make maneuvers, including turns and twists. Edgeington gave an interview with the Associated Press in May last year while competing for a spot on the U.S. Parachute Team. 'It's not necessarily scary to jump out of the plane anymore,' she said. Killed: Jessica Edgeington, seen here at a swooping course,  died Wednesday afternoon after flying out of Skydive DeLand in Florida on Wednesday . Edgeington continued in the interview: 'I get competition nerves when I'm at something like this. 'So that's probably the most nerve wracking thing, is getting ready to compete. 'Trying to perform and do your best. Hopefully not mess up.' On her Facebook page, Edgeington lists herself as a 'canopy coach' for PD Factory Team. Canopy coaches educate skydivers of every level, from beginners working on accuracy to advanced semi-pros and elite military personnel. Her page was inundated with messages from family, friends and colleagues following the tragedy on Wednesday. Crash: Jessica Edgeington, 33, of Villa Rica, Georgia, died Wednesday afternoon at Skydive DeLand . It is the second death at the the DeLand field this year. In January, William 'Blake' Marston, a Navy SEAL learning how to skydive, died after hitting the land too hard, according to My News 13. The field is at DeLand Municipal Airport. Tributes: Hundreds of tributes have flooded in for the skydiver, describing her as a 'wonderful soul' Two other men died in separate incidents at Skydive DeLand in 2013. That year, in the 3.2 million jumps that happened across the country, the United States Parachute Associated recorded a total of 24 fatal skydiving accidents. There are thousands of dives at Skydive Delandeach year. It is also the home of SkyDive University, a professional skydiving instruction and coaching organization.","Jessica Edgeington, 33, had made over 6,000 jumps .

4177,"A drug-addicted Ryanair steward who swiped a £500 camera left on a flight was rumbled by the owner who spotted the listing on eBay and reported him to police. Teacher Aaron Galloway, 23, was on a half-term city break to Prague when he left his expensive SLR camera on the seat as he landed in the Czech Republic capital. Ground crew phoned the flight attendants within minutes but cabin crew said there was no sign of the £499 Nikon. Flighty: Ryanair steward Fernando Miguel Andrade Viseu begged Adam Galloway not to report him to police when he replied to a message warning him that he could prove that he was selling stolen goods . When Aaron got home, he went on eBay to find a replacement and was astonished to see his own camera for sale with just 35 minutes left on the auction. He messaged seller Fernando Miguel Andrade Viseu, who confessed to the theft - and admitted being a Ryanair flight attendant. Aaron checked his eBay profile and found Viseu had sold 118 items in the previous few months, including Ray-Ban sunglasses and expensive Skullcandy headphones. Snapshot: Aaron realises that the camera advertised on eBay is the one he left on the flight . Rumbled: Teacher Aaron realises the seller must work for Ryanair and sends over some strong words . 35 minutes to go: The listing that Aaron Galloway found when looking for a replacement camera . The Portuguese-born thief begged Aaron not to tell police and said he would lose his job but officers raided his home near Stansted and found the D5200 Nikon. Viseu was charged with the theft of the camera as well as stealing a Kindle from an unknown owner and pleaded guilty in court. However, he's not being investigated for any other offences at this time or being pursued under the proceeds of crime act. Magistrates in Chelmsford, Essex, ordered to attend a drug rehabilitation programme for six months by the court on March 9 and pay £145 costs. They also imposed a community order and ordered him to do 100 hours of unpaid work. Ryanair have now sacked him. Aaron, a primary school teacher, said: 'When I saw it on Ebay I couldn't believe it. 'I was angry with Ryanair to be honest. How can they not notice someone just taking things off the seats? 'He had deleted everything from the camera - photos of Christmas, of a family member who had passed away and my graduation - all wiped. 'I'd been looking forward to taking lots of photos on my holiday and that was just ruined.' Steward Viseu posing next to a Ryanair plane, left, and Aaron Galloway, right, with his camera in Brighton . Aaron went online when he got back home to Brighton, East Sussex, after his three-night break and was astonished to see his camera. He said: 'That night I decided to check Ebay - I'm not sure what made me do it, but I thought I would just have a look. 'Right there, with just 33 minutes to go, was my camera. 'I knew it was mine because the description with the strap, the lens, the battery, the memory card - all mine. 'It was a three day auction starting the same day I lost my camera, and the item location was Stansted. 'I contact the non-emergency police number but only got through to the switchboard and I was panicking. 'So I thought I had nothing to lose so I messaged the seller, expecting them to just ignore me. 'He admitted he worked for Ryanair and had taken my camera. I was pretty surprised because actually he could have ignored me and there was nothing I could have done. 'But he said he was really sorry.' Begging: Viseu begs teacher Aaron not to report him to police and offers to return the camera . Viseu - who was listed on eBay as fstoffel2013 - sent Aaron a message saying: 'My apologies for this. I'll obviously return the camera to you. 'Please tell me when you return and I will meet you at the terminal. 'Of course my job is important to me. I'll meet you at the terminal or whatever you want to. 'I found the camera at the end of the day and I will return it to you, of course. 'Please, please don't report me.' Aaron added: 'The police initially said they wanted me to organise to go and collect it off him in person, and they would arrest him there. 'But then once I showed them the evidence they went to his home and arrested him there.' A spokesman for Essex Police said: 'We arrested a 34-year-old man from the Stansted area on Friday February 20 on suspicion of theft.'","Teacher Adam Galloway got home and found Nikon on eBay just 35 minutes before end of auction .

So it comes as a surprise that the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - located along the no-man's land between the North and South - is next to a burgeoning surf spot for South Korean hipsters, gangsters, ex-pats and its jet-setting adventure class. Photos captured at the site show an eclectic mix of people going about their day-to-day duties, where fishermen and day-trippers are placed alongside soldiers, tanks and their fortified military installations. The DMZ was established in 1953 as a buffer zone to separate the North from the South. Surfer Shannon Aston, from New Zealand, said he felt compelled to start photographing the area while he was living and working in South Korea as a teacher. Mr Aston added: 'The military is ever present and must be respected and everybody does (respect it), but Korea has been divided for decades, so life just goes on. 'There was never much tension, only when people in the north would defect near that coast or security was ramped up after a skirmish or incident between the two countries.' The beaches, often filled with foreigners and day-trippers from the capital Seoul, features an 'overlapping' of military installations along the coast as it nears the border with the north, he said.

3075,"Fleas in Arizona have tested positive for the plague and could spread the deadly disease to humans, according to officials. The plague, which famously killed millions of Europeans during the Black Death, is most commonly carried by fleas and rodents. Prairie dog deaths at Picture Canyon in Arizona alerted officials to the possibility of an outbreak. Parasitic insects from the preserve near a water treatment plant in Flagstaff were found to carry the illness. Scroll down for video . Authorities near Flagstaff, Arizona, have found fleas infected with plague after prairie dogs in Picture Canyon began dying (file photos) The plague, which killed millions of Europeans in the 1300s, causes pustules on the skin and is still contracted by 2,000 people a year (file photo) Human cases have developed from close contact with cats who have preyed on infected vermin and  residents in the Southwest have been warned about dangers of the disease while camping. The Southwestern US is similar to the plains of Central Asia where plague began, Professor David Wagner of Northern Arizona University told the Arizona Daily Sun. Plague is still contracted by as many as 2,000 people a year, according to the World Health Organization, though the vast majority of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Prairie dogs are particularly susceptible to illness because they live in social burrows, and 90 per cent of the furry creatures' colony can eventually be wiped out if plague infects one member. The disease's rodent host dies, when fleas will look for more blood to drink, including from people. The vast majority of human plague cases reported in the US are in the arid climate of the Southwest, which scientists say is similar to the disease's homeland of Central Asia . The discovery of the disease at Picture Canyon (pictured) has prompted a warning from authorities about the dangers posed by dead rodents . Insecticide has been sprayed in prairie dog burrows in Picture Canyon to halt the plague's spread. Symptoms of pain in humans include fever, chills and muscle pain. At later stages it causes gangrene and a large amount of pustules, or buboes, on the skin. The incubation period could be up to seven days. Modern medications are effective in fighting the plague, also known by its bacterial name Yersinia pestis,  though it can be deadly if left untreated. The last plague epidemic in the United States was in Los Angeles between 1924 and 1925, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Plague originally came to North America via rodents on steamships from Asia.

4336,"Amir Khan believes Kell Brook has called him out so that he can have the 'one big payday' which has so far eluded him during his 10-and-a-half year career. Brook, who defeated Jo Jo Dan to retain his IBF welterweight title last month, immediately challenged Khan in a post-fight interview but the Bolton-born boxer has instead agreed a bout on May 30, with his opponent yet to be confirmed. Khan has reiterated his intention to take on Brook within the next 12 months, although he insists that the undefeated 28-year-old only wants the fight because of the money it will earn him. Amir Khan (left), pictured during his last fight against Devon Alexander, has blasted Kell Brook's motives . Brook (right) shakes hands with British Superbike champion Shane Byrne at Donington Park on Tuesday . In an interview with iFL TV, Khan said: 'He's only faced one decent opponent in his whole career, so he has no room to talk. It seems to me that he's just calling me out for that one big payday. 'If he keeps going on like this, that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day, he's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that I can't fight then because of Ramadan. 'And he's putting down my opponents, who are still better opponents than his opponents, like Jo Jo Dan, who should be called No No Dan, to be honest with you, because end of day, he's not done anything in his career.' Khan had announced a fight with Chris Algieri next month but he has now backtracked on that, claiming that there are 'some more options on the table'. Khan has now denied that he will face Chris Algieri next month, claiming there are 'some more options' Chris Algieri lost every round to Manny Pacquiao when he took on the Filipino star last November . Brook is desperate to fight Khan but his fellow Brit rejected the chance to face him at Wembley in June . A £5million clash with Brook at Wembley on June 13 was also an option but Khan rejected the offer as he will not fight during Ramadan because of his Islamic faith. He added: 'Like I said, this Algieri fight, if it happens, it's making me a lot of money; money that Kell Brook's not seen. That's why he's probably dying. Amir's making millions when he's not even seen his first million. 'There's classes in boxing. There's fighters in boxing who are the A-class fighters, the likes of Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather, who talk about and mention and say they know who Amir Khan is. 'When it comes to Kell Brook, who knows Kell Brook in America? Which fighter, apart from Shawn Porter, knows Kell Brook? Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao don't know who Kell Brook is, so I don't know what he's going on about trying to say he's a big name. 'Kell Brook's going on like he's the next guy to fight Mayweather when he's not even a big ticket seller. He might be big in his own backyard in Sheffield, but other than Sheffield, no-one knows him. Brook is hoping to fight Khan within the next 12 months as he looks to extend his unbeaten streak . Khan claims that Brook is not even a big name in the UK and is not able to face the world's biggest names . 'The way he's tried to come across to the US public is like he's a super-big name in the UK. He's not a big name in the UK.' And Khan insists that he is not avoiding Brook, even though the fight will be of greater benefit to the Sheffield-born star. 'Look, do I need the fight against Kell Brook?,' said Khan. 'I make a lot of money regardless if I fight Kell Brook. 'I will make a lot of money in this sport and I've made a lot of money in this sport of boxing. Kell Brook needs me to make that big money. 'Without me, he'll never make that big money unless he goes out and fights the top guys like Pacquiao, Mayweather, and Marquez, but I can't see him fighting those guys because he's always scared to get beat by them and lose his title.'","Amir Khan has rejected a £5million fight with Kell Brook in June .

1958,"An 82-year-old woman died after sitting in the same chair in her South Carolina home for six months, authorities have said. Barbara Anne Beam was being looked after by her elderly sister and nephew when she passed away in her bedroom in Greenville on January 2. The coroner's office found she died from a blood clot in her lung and ruled that her death was homicide by neglect. Prosecutors are now deciding whether to charge the family members. Officers were called to the home on January 2 and the smell was so bad that some of the first firefighters on the scene set up a fan by the door. Scene: Barbara Beam died in her South Carolina home in January after sitting for six months and prosecutors are considering charges against her caretakers. The identity of the woman pictured is not known . An officer noticed ulcers on the back of the 200-pound woman's legs and that body fluids were staining the sunken seat of her chair, according to the police report. The sister told the officer that Beam 'stays in the chair located in the bedroom and that she had not moved out of the chair for approximately six months,' according to a police report. She added that, a few hours before her sister's death, Beam refused to eat and they watched a soap opera together in her bedroom before she went to the kitchen. When she returned, Beam was slumped in her chair and the sister and nephew could find no pulse. When paramedics took Beam out of the chair and put her on the floor, her legs were still bent in a sitting position when the officer arrived. She was not wearing pants, according to the report. When she died, she also had deep vein thrombosis, which are clots caused by sitting for long periods of time, and a serious infection that started in her kidneys, the coroner's office said. 'The decedent had significant ulcerations and wounds - pressure ulcers, essentially - on her legs from prolonged inactivity and prolonged time spent in a chair,' Dr. James Fulcher, the deputy medical examiner who performed the autopsy said, the Greenville News reported. Police have turned their file on the case over to prosecutors, who are reviewing it, Greenville Police spokesman Johnathan Bragg said on Friday.","Barbara Beam died in the home she shared with her sister and nephew in Greenville, South Carolina in January .

5363,"The dawn of a new era of space travel may be upon us after Amazon's Jeff Bezos successfully tested a vehicle that will take tourists into space. Mr Bezos' firm, called the Blue Origin company, has long spoken of its desire to take paying astronauts into the cosmos. And now it has performed the first successful test of the vehicle they hope will make that dream a reality. Scroll down for video . Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company has completed a successful spaceflight test in West Texas (shown). The New Shepard vehicle rose to a height of 58 miles (94km) - four miles short of space - before landing. It was unmanned, but will ultimately take six people into space . The test took place from the company’s launch site in West Texas. Called New Shepard, the vehicle consists of a main booster rocket and a six-seater capsule on top, standing 60ft (18 metres) tall. The New Shepard system will take astronauts to space on suborbital journeys. It includes a Crew Capsule carrying six astronauts atop a separate rocket-powered Propulsion Module, launched from the firm's West Texas Launch Site. Following liftoff, the combined vehicles accelerate for approximately two and a half minutes. The Propulsion Module then shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the Crew Capsule. The Propulsion Module will finish its flight, descend to Earth, and autonomously perform a rocket-powered vertical landing. The Crew Capsule will go on to coast to the edge of space, providing astronauts with a view to the curvature of the Earth and the beauty of our planet. After descent and re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere, the Crew Capsule will land under parachutes no more than a few miles from the launch site. In addition, the New Shepard vehicle will provide opportunities for researchers to fly experiments into space and a microgravity environment. For this, the first test flight of the entire architecture, it was unmanned - but the company hopes to soon start taking customers into space. The cost of a ticket has not yet been announced, but estimates suggest it will be around £130,000 $200,000 - similar to a flight on Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. The difference, however, is that while Galactic relies on using a plane to slowly rise into the atmosphere, New Shepard takes off straight up and lands back on the ground. This is known as vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL). And Blue Origin is also much more secretive - with this successful test flight taking many by surprise. In video released by Blue Origin, the booster - using liquid hydrogen and oxygen - lifts the New Shepard vehicle to an altitude of 58 miles (94km). This is four miles (six kilometres) short of the official boundary of space - the Karman Line - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future. Once it reached its peak altitude, accelerating at 3Gs, the booster separated from the capsule. ‘The in-space separation of the crew capsule from the propulsion module was perfect,’ Mr Bezso said in a blog post. ‘Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return.’ The flight came as somewhat of a surprise because the company didn't make any announcements in the build up that it would be launching a rocket - unlike its rivals Virgin Galactic and SpaceX who are very open about the tests they will be performing . At peak altitude, 307,000ft (58 miles, 94km) up, the main booster separated from the capsule. On the left, the booster can be seen falling away, while on the right a distant view of the separation is seen. The booster failed to land successfully but the capsule landed without a hitch . Ultimately, the flights will enable six people to go to space. While in space, huge windows will give the customers a stunning view of Earth (artist's impression shown), and they'll also have several minutes of weightlessness, before the capsule falls to Earth and lands using parachutes . Here the capsule is seen returning to Earth on this test flight with its three parachutes. ‘Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return,' Amazon's Jeff Bezos said in a blog post announcing the successful flight . The booster is designed to be able to land on the ground and be reusable, much like rival SpaceX’s own reusable rocket system. On this occasion, however, the booster lost pressure in its hydraulic system and was not recovered. Mr Bezos said the firm was already working on an improved system to make sure the error doesn’t happen again. ‘Assembly of propulsion module serial numbers 2 and 3 is already underway - we’ll be ready to fly again soon,’ he said. In a video a small crowd was seen watching the successful flight from the company's launch site in West Texas - but for the most part the launch was kept a secret . Jeff Bezos (pictured) is better known as the CEO and founder of Amazon, with a fortune of £22.5 billion ($34.7 billion). He founded his Blue Origin company in 2000 . Elon Musk, the PayPal co-founder and electric car maker, is competing against Bezos to develop a re-usable rocket . An isolated edge of vast West Texas is home to a highly secretive part of the 21st-century space race, one of two being directed in the Lone Star State by internet billionaires whose personalities and corporate strategies seem worlds apart. The presence of Blue Origin, LLC, the brainchild of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, barely registers in nearby Van Horn, a way station along Interstate 10, a full decade after he began buying land in one of Texas' largest and most remote counties. At the opposite end — of Texas and the competition — is the highly visible SpaceX venture, led by PayPal co-founder and electric car maker Elon Musk. His company contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and is building a launch site about 600 miles from Van Horn, on the southernmost Texas Gulf coast, with the much-publicized goal of sending humans to Mars. SpaceX and Blue Origin are among several U.S. companies engaged in the private space business. Both men have seemingly unlimited resources — Bezos' wealth is estimated at nearly $35 billion, Musk's at $12 billion — and lofty aspirations: launching a new era of commercial space operations, in part by cutting costs through reusable rockets. Earlier this year a dispute over a design of a floating landing platform - which would be used to launch and land rockets in the middle of the ocean - was dragged through the courts. But a judge said the confrontation would be allowed to continue. In part they are racing to be the first to manufacture and successfully operate reusable rockets - making space flight cheaper. According to The Washington Post, SpaceX has been working on the technology for years, and in January attempted the unprecedented landing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket on a floating barge it calls an autonomous spaceport droneship. However the barge and the rocket exploded. SpaceX founder and Musk, center, and Texas Governor Rick Perry turn the first shovel-full of sand at the groundbreaking ceremony for the SpaceX launch pad at Boca Chica Beach, Texas, in September 2014 . Combined, the booster and capsule stand 60ft (18 metres) tall, with a feather painted onto the side . This is the walkway astronauts will ultimately use when the company stars its manned flights . In this first test flight, the New Shepard vehicle rose to an altitude of 58 miles (94km). This is four miles (six kilometres) short of the official boundary of space - the Karman Line - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future . The flight of the capsule, however, passed without a hitch and it successfully landed on the ground with the help of three parachutes. The company is keen on VTVL because it is ‘scalable to a very large size,’ according to Mr Bezos. And he noted that the company was already working on a larger vehicle, New Shepard’s ‘Very Big Brother’, which is apparently many times New Shepard’s size with five times as much thrust. The company has not yet revealed when it’s next flight will be, or when manned flights will begin. 'We won’t be publishing a calendar for our test flight programme. And, nothing further to contribute regarding pricing,' a spokesperson from Blue Origin told MailOnline. But following this successful flight, many will be expecting the company to go from strength to strength.","His Blue Origin company completed a successful test in West Texas .

9391,"Dani Alves posted a picture of himself with his trousers down on his Instagram account on Thursday. With one message coming out of the player’s camp and a very different one emerging from the Nou Camp it’s difficult to know who feels they have been left exposed by who. We take a look at the contract wrangle and ask: could he really end up at Manchester United? Dani Alves, out of contract at the end of the campaign, is pictured training for Barcelona on Friday . His contract runs out on June 30 why has it come to this? Barcelona had never planned to keep Alves beyond this season. He’s served them brilliantly but he will be 32 next month and on  £85,000-a-week he is one of their top earning defenders along with Gerard Pique. What they were not counting on is their own incompetence in finding a replacement for him and the FIFA transfer ban that stops them buying anyone this summer. So now they want him to stay? They do, but very much on their terms. The club are letting it be known they have offered him a two-year deal with an option of a third year depending on the number of games played in the second year. Alves’ camp say it’s actually a one-year deal to be renewed for a second year, and then a third year, only if he plays a certain number of matches. The new contract also comes with incentives. If he wins things then he will end up earning the same money but his basic earnings before bonuses would drop. Barcelona defender Alves has been sounded out by Manchester United over a move to Old Trafford . And there are other clubs who will gladly take him? After weeks of rumours that the suitors were queuing around the Nou Camp to sign him up it now seems that one big club has offered him a three-year deal with none of the strings, sub-clauses and trap-doors as the Barca deal. And that club is Manchester United? United are the prime suspects with PSG out of the running. But Alves' camp say now is not the time to name the club. You sound doubtful… . Only in as much as if Manchester United had really offered him a three-year deal would he still be haggling with Barcelona? Surely a Premier League swansong at Old Trafford is the perfect way to round off what has been a remarkable career with the Spanish giants – winning four leagues, three cups and two Champions League titles. Perhaps he just really wants to stay in Barcelona? The children he has with ex-wife Dinorah Santa Ana (who is now his agent) live in the city and after 13 years in Spain he is reluctant to leave. He is hoping Barcelona, desperate because they can't sign players, make him a better offer. Dinorah Santa Ana, Alves ex-wife and now his agent, addressed the media earlier this week . But if he does end up at United will he be a success? It’s easy to look at the gold shoes, the denim waistcoats and the polka dot ties and just see an eccentric extrovert who plays football in his part-time. That does a tremendous injustice to easily the most gifted and successful right-back of his generation. He remains super-fit and if there is slightly less energy to get up and down the pitch as there once was perhaps that wouldn’t be a bad thing – Louis van Gaal is hardly going to want him flying forward Barcelona style at every possibility. He remains very watchable and has a tenacity and speed of recovery that means he never has been the defensive liability some have depicted. The Brazil international is hopeful Barcelona make him an improved offer so he can stay at the Nou Camp . You make it sound as though Barcelona would be foolish to let him leave... In view of the fact that if they allow him to walk away they will end up having to play Douglas at right back then that may well be the case. The strange summer signing from Sao Paolo who cost £4m and has started one game looks completely out of his depth. Put it this way – the manager Luis Enrique wants Alves to stay.","Dani Alves is out of contract at Barcelona at the end of the season .

3818,"Chris Christie's wife has quit her big-money job on Wall Street in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016. May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video . Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co . According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire . Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him . She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state.","Mary Pat Christie, 51, quit her position at finance firm Angleo Gordon & Co .

2313,"It seems an accepted trend that Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas struggles during the second half of the season and the Spanish midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday. The 27-year-old spoke of his happiness in south west London earlier this week but his form has significantly dipped from that of the player who, around Christmas, looked a dead-cert to break the Barclays Premier League record for assists. On Tuesday - his first international appearance since October - he was given just four out of 10 by one Spanish newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the Premier League title following a Capital One Cup win, questions remain about Fabregas' durability. Cesc Fabregas (right) captained Spain on Tuesday but his poor form continued as they lost 2-0 in Holland . The Chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the European champions fell to defeat . After a brilliant start to the season at Stamford Bridge, the Spaniard's form has dropped off somewhat of late . 'I'm playing almost every minute of every match (with Chelsea) and that's what makes me happy,' he said this week. But a long, intense campaign on his return to England is taking its toll on the Spaniard. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the Amsterdam ArenA, adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the Blues' title charge decline of late. Fabregas captained the European champions in the Dutch capital but struggled to make any real impact against Manchester United's Daley Blind or goalscorer Davy Klaassen. Jose Mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the Premier League run-in . Diego Costa and Fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in Chelsea's 3-2 win at Hull City . Fabregas was brilliant for Chelsea in their big win away at Swansea City in January but has struggled since . After his £30million transfer to Chelsea last summer, Fabregas' former club Barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-Christmas slump. 'There has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club,' it read. 'Despite glowing starts to each campaign, Cesc's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close. 'From being someone who joined in with the attack, supplying and scoring goals, the magic tended to fade later on in each season.' And it seems to have rung true on the stats front. Having picked up 15 Premier League assists by mid-January, he has just one in five games he has played since, and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015. Thierry Henry's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form, Fabregas is now on track to fall just short. However, with nine games to play Chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against. Fabregas' former team-mate Thierry Henry (right) holds the record for assists in a Premier League season . Henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and Fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump . When he left Barcelona, the  club commented on Fabregas' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump . Their opponents on Saturday, Stoke City, as well as Queens Park Rangers, Manchester United, Arsenal, Leicester City and West Bromwich Albion have all been opened up by Fabregas' passing ability this season, while he scored in Chelsea's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in October. The personal accolade will be important to the midfielder, but more key is the boost it could give to his club. Chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games, and if Fabregas finds form again the Premier League title could be wrapped up within weeks. Mourinho will hope his assist for Diego Costa in Chelsea's last game against Hull City is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong. Fabregas laid on an assist for Costa in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull City, but that was his first in five games . Mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the Premier League title race, with Fabregas a key cog .","Cesc Fabregas' poor form continued for Spain against Holland on Tuesday .

1558,"She hadn't spoken for weeks after her health deteriorated rapidly due to terminal brain cancer. But one day recently, Sara Martin, from Lititz, Pennsylvania, uttered a single word: 'Florida'. Now, the mother-of-three's devoted family is taking her there for what will likely be her final holiday. They leave for Sarasota, south-west Florida, today. Final holiday: Brain cancer sufferer Sara Martin, from Pennsylvania, is being driven to Florida today after she uttered the word 'Florida' following weeks of not speaking. Above, Mrs Martin, center, sits in the rented van her family is taking to Sarasota, alongside her daughters Gretchen, 11, and Carlie, 12, who are staying at home .

Above, she is pictured with her family in 2013, three years after her diagnosis but more than a year before her health declined this winter . Mrs Martin, 37, who has three children - Carlie, 12, Gretchen, 11, and nine-year-old Connor - with her husband Dean, was diagnosed with an aggressive, inoperable form of brain cancer in 2010. Since her diagnosis, she has taken part in charity runs, gone on holidays and made countless invaluable memories with her family. All the while, she has been well supported by her loved ones. However, Mrs Martin's health declined this winter after she underwent a second round of radiation treatment, prompting her relatives to arrange for her to receive hospice care at her home. Soon, she no longer talked. But during a recent visit, her sister, Amy Martin came up with a new way to try to get her sibling to smile, nod, or say something - offer her the opportunity to go to Florida. 'If you say 'Florida,' I'll get dad to take us,' Amy Martin promised her sister. But she added: 'But you've got to tell me. I've got to know if you really want to go.' Although Mrs Martin, a former physical therapy assistant at Lancaster General Hospital, said nothing for the rest of the day, the next morning she shocked her relatives while she was being dressed.

4846,"Dr Unt Tun Maung, 43, asked the vulnerable teen to remove her bra before cupping and squeezing each of her breasts, Durham Crown Court heard . A married GP who fondled a vulnerable teenager's breasts when she came to him complaining of chest pains has been jailed for 18 months. Dr Unt Tun Maung, 43, was working as a locum GP when he assaulted the patient during a routine examination at a Teesside medical centre in 2012, Durham Crown Court was previously told. The father-of-one, of Chester-le-Street, County Durham, had spent 12 years working in the NHS, but has now lost everything because of a 'moment of madness', his lawyer told the court. The attack took place during a routine appointment in July 2012 when the girl went to Maung complaining of chest pains. Maung then asked the teenager to remove her bra, before cupping and squeezing her breasts before telling her to put her clothes back on. After the incident, the woman texted a friend to say she felt she had been sexually abused. In a statement read to the court, she said had not wanted to believe she had been taken advantage of, but she could not rid it from her mind. Then, when she visited another doctor a few months later with another chest infection, she panicked while being examined, the court heard. A complaint was made to the NHS, although the police were not alerted for 'several months', prosecutor Peter Makepeace said. Dr Maung came from a medical family and had worked in the NHS since moving to the UK in 2000, Mr Hurst said, and was held in high regard both professionally and personally. He had devoted 12 years of his life to working in the NHS and had also helped contribute to his Buddhist community, defence barrister Andrew Hurst said. Mr Hurst asked the judge to suspend the sentence, saying Maung's earning potential had been decimated and he had lost the respect of the community, to the point that his conviction 'effectively amounts to a life sentence'. Maung was jailed for 18 months for the attack, which took place in 2012, is currently suspended from practicing and is facing a General Medical Council investigation . Judge Prince told Maung he had previously been of 'exemplary' character, had made a significant contribution to society, both as a 'diligent and dedicated doctor' and in the wider community. He added that Maung was clearly held in high regard by numerous people of high standing. However, the judge concluded that only an immediate prison sentence would be appropriate for the crime and deter others from behaving in such a way in future. Dr Maung has been suspended from general practice since October 2013 and now faces a General Medical Council investigation. Judge Prince added that his NHS career was 'unquestionably over'. Maung will also be placed on the sex offenders' register for ten years, but was not told to pay the victim any compensation, though she can pursue him through the civil courts.","Dr Unt Tun Maung, 43, working as a locum GP on Teesside at time of attack .

7499,"Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta . McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club . At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy . McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round . To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club . Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.","One Direction star Niall Horan will caddie for Rory McIlroy on Wednesday .

2845,"One New York-based teacher has found an incredibly fashionable and glamorous way to supplement his public school income, working as a model for some of the world’s top designers. Sam Pearce, 24, of Milton, Massachusetts, initially came to New York City to peruse a career in education, and soon after arriving in the Big Apple he landed a job teaching English to eighth graders in Brooklyn, New York. But just a few months after landing the job, the six-foot, green-eyed Brown University graduate was 'discovered' on the subway by another model, who promptly asked whether he could send Mr. Pearce’s picture to his own modeling agency in the hopes of getting him signed up. Model behavior: New York teacher Sam Pearce, 24, was discovered on the F train in New York City and now juggles his career as an eighth-grade English teacher with a side job modelling for top designers . 'I was taken aback and flattered, but also kind of incredulous,' he told Racked of the encounter, which took place on the F train. 'He was just like, ""Hey, you're a model, right?"" I said, ""Noooo, I'm a teacher, dude.""' Soon after, Mr. Pearce, who was at the time teaching a summer school course and standing to earn $45,530 in the coming school year, signed a modelling contract with RED NYC and started posing for designer lookbooks and walking in fashion shows in London and Milan under the name Sam Worthen, a pseudonym taken from his mother's maiden name. But the hunky instructor insists that he doesn't let his side job posing for Alexander McQueen, Diesel Black Gold, and DKNY interfere with his responsibility to his students. Classroom to catwalk: Mr. Pearce says his two jobs are similar in that they are both hectic and he needs to keep a straight face during each of them . Renaissance man: Besides teaching and modelling, Mr. Pearce also speaks French, Spanish, and Italian and composes his own music . 'My agents have been pretty great about understanding that teaching is my priority, and they've gotten me jobs that require me to miss little or no school,' he said. 'I did the Alexander McQueen show — that was my first real show — over a weekend. I flew out to London on Saturday evening, did the show, and then flew home immediately after; so I was in London for 12 hours.' He also managed to fit walking in New York Fashion Week this February into his teaching schedule, modelling in shows during New York City public schools' week-long winter break. In fact, Mr. Pearce managed to maintain the secret of his second identity until very recently, and even then, he admits he only revealed himself because he thought the publicity could benefit his kids. Male model: Mr. Pearce knows there's more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking; he also places a lot of importance on getting his English students to read . 'I thought if people take interest in my story I could convert that interest into resources for my students,' he told Fox CT. Mr. Pearce launched a Go-Fund-Me campaign called The Right Book to raise funds to buy all 67 of his students new books, and the attention his plea received helped him quickly surpass his goal of $3,000 in donations. He is now urging would-be donors to help more teachers and students through fundraising website DonorsChoose.org.

A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5.

Ashley Arenson said boyfriend Dan Fredinburg, 33, had a way of making people around him feel special and urged them to accomplish everything they wanted. The Arkansas-native is one of four Americans confirmed to have died when an earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday, causing a tsunami of snow and ice to engulf the base camp. Ashley Arenson (left) said boyfriend Dan Fredinburg, 33, had a way of making people around him feel special and urged them to accomplish everything they wanted. He was one of the four American citizens to die at Mount Everest during the deadly avalanche on Saturday . Arenson revealed that the Google engineer and Arkansas-native wanted to return to Mount Everest following the devastation of the avalanche last year - when 16 people were killed . After hearing the news of his death. Arenson posted an image of Fridenburg wearing a white t-shirt on Instagram alongside the message: Modern day superman. This photo was taken at The Laundry, SF during construction in September. 'Pure joy overcame @danfredinburg as he showed me one of the ways he is going to change the world.' Speaking to CNN, Arenson said: 'He's brought out the best version in me. He would constantly make you want to be the best person you can. 'All of his choices were to help him become happy. 'He had this way of making the people around him just feel special without even trying, and make people feel like they could accomplish anything they wanted,' she added. She revealed that he wanted to return to Mount Everest following the devastation of the avalanche last year - when 16 people were killed. The Arkansas School of Math graduate had planned to attempt to reach the summit, when his trip was cancelled. He had been travelling to the Himalayas frequently as part of the Google Adventures team, who were mapping out extreme routes around the world. 'I don't think Dan would want people to do just one thing. He would want them to constantly challenge themselves,' Arenson said. 'What Dan would want is for every single person out there to live life to the fullest and live in the moment because that's what he did. That's how he lived his life.' Arenson sat alongside one of Fredinburg's closest friends Michael North. The couple often went on adventures together and would share their experiences on Instagram. Arenson said Fredinnburg brought out the best in her . On this social media post four months ago, Arenson said she couldn't wait to be reunited with her 'partner in crime'. The pair met again before he set off to Everest for the expedition . The pair were wearing yellow scarves, which are given during a Nepalese ceremony to ensure  safe passage over the mountain. He said: 'We would say Dan had this ability to create a reality-distortion field. That he had so much power, he could change reality ... He would make the world just such a happy, vibrant place to be.' North also started a company with Fredinburg called Save the Ice, a group which travels the world to document climate change hotspots. They released a statement following his death saying: 'Save the Ice mourns the loss of our co-founder Dan Fredinburg, who perished during this morning's avalanche while climbing Mt. Everest for our ""Expedition Everest"" campaign. We have lost a great friend, inspiring adventurer, and, above all, a warrior for the planet.' His friends have since uploaded a Crowdrise page in Fredinburg's memory, with all the funds going to relief efforts and an orphanage he was involved in. More than $38,000 has been raised so far. Fredinburg started at Google in 2007. Beforehand he graduated from the Arkansas School of Math, Science and Art in Hot Springs in 1999, before moving on with his career. He started at the technology company as product manager and then head of privacy at Google X, the company's secretive arm best known for 'moonshot' projects such as the self-driving car.

Carrie Fisher, 58, who is reprising her role as Princess Leia, and Mark Hamill, 63, who is Luke Skywalker, were arm-in-arm on the stage just before the second trailer for the December film was rolled out. Not on hand was Harrison Ford, who is the franchise's Han Solo. Producer Kathleen Kennedy explained the 72-year-old was 'resting' after miraculously surviving a March plane crash in Los Angeles. Scroll down for trailer... Together again: Carrie Fisher, who is reprising her role as Princess Leia, and Mark Hamill, who is Luke Skywalker, were arm in arm on the stage in Anaheim on Thursday before the second trailer for Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens was rolled out . In recovery mode: Not on hand was Harrison Ford, who is the franchise's Han Solo. Director JJ Abrams explained the 72-year-old was 'resting' after miraculously surviving a March plane crash in Los Angeles; here the actor is seen in July after an accident on the Star Wars set . It was announced early on that Ford would not be a part of the panel (though later he was the high point of the trailer). 'He's not here today but he's in everyone's thought, Harrison Ford, he's a total bad a***. 'The amazing thing about Harrison – and I don't think anybody out there will be surprised – is he is the only person who could make an emergency landing on a golf course in front of two doctors,' producer Kennedy said. The A team: Kathleen Kennedy, pictured center, said, 'The amazing thing about Harrison – and I don't think anybody out there will be surprised – is he is the only person who could make an emergency landing on a golf course in front of two doctors'; to her left is director JJ Abrams . They have a bond: Both Hamill and Fisher thanked the fans for their support over the decades . The vet meets the new faces: Fisher smiled as she posed with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley . Kennedy said he was home resting, and getting well as fast as he can. 'I can't even begin to tell you how much he wanted to be here,' she said. 'When we open the movie, Han Solo will be very active in what we are doing.' Abrams then chimed in. 'He's doing great and he's working hard,' Abrams said. 'I had respect for him all my life, but I've never had more respect for a guy until I saw how he landed that plane. The way they were: (from left) Hamill, Fisher and Ford in the original Star Wars movie in 1977 . 'He's more of a hero in that move than in all the films he's been in,' he added. 'By the time the movie opens he will be very actively involved.' Abrams also called the veteran actor, who is married to Calista Flockhart, a 'real hero.' Ford was also injured on the set of the Star Wars film and production was brought to a halt. But he recovered without any long-term issues. Fisher came out on stage in a black blazer and red skirt. Next was Peter Mayhew, who plays Chewbacca. Last was Hamill. The audience went wild for over 10 seconds. 'Chewie, we're home': Ford was featured at the end of the trailer for Star Wars VII . She's taking care of him: Ford's wife Calista Flockhart has been seeing to her husband's needs; here they are pictured in 2008 . When asked about her iconic hairstyle, Fisher said, 'The buns are tired now so I don't think we'll have the futuristic buns but we will have an alternate that will not include the metal bikini.' She also thanked the fans and made a twisted joke about how she is glad people have played with toys of her - referring to her Princess Leia dolls - which drew laughs. Hamill added, 'George originally called the film the most expensive small film he ever made.' He then thanked the fans for their 'passion.' 'My entire adult life I have felt such love from you. You're more than just fans, you're family.' On the run: Daisy and John can be seen running from an explosion in the trailer . R2D2 then appeared on stage and an image from the movie was shared with the robot in it. The 'tinkerers' were also brought out to talk about working with the droid. Next came BB-8, a rolling droid that appeared in the first Star Wars VII trailer. It made noises while circling R2D2. Daisy described her character, 'She is a scavenger and very solitary until she meets another character and that's when the adventure begins.' Down for now: An aircraft is buried in sand on a new planet . Oscar added, 'He's been sent on a mission by a certain princess and he meets John Boyega's character and their fates are forever intertwined.' John then said he would not confirm whether he was a Stormtrooper or not. Anthony Daniels also made the event - he plays C3PO. And then came the trailer. No fear: A pilot is seen in battle in the film that has a December release . The clip was the first time the vet character Han Solo, played by Ford, was seen. He was joined by Chewbacca at the end of the trailer and is heard saying, 'Chewie, we're home.' The trailer opens on what appears to be the newly revealed desert planet Jaku. As a speeder races across the sands we see an ancient downed Star Destroyer and a skeletal X-Wing, which clearly crashed there from orbit decades ago. We then see an unknown pair of hands holding the mangled mask of Darth Vader, melted and disfigured from the Sith lord's funeral pyre at the end of Return Of The Jedi. A hint of the old era: A skull of Darth Vader - aka Anakin Skywalker - is shown in the beginning of the clip . We hear Hamill's voice reprising a line from the 1983 film: The force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. My sister has it. He then appears to hand a lightsaber to another unseen character - a strong suggestion Luke Skywalker has had a child. Daisy, Oscar and John are then all introduced in the clip and it is hinted that they are in allegiance. Harrison appears with Chewbacca only at the very end. The menace is always there: Stormtroopers are also seen in the trailer, and they are located in a snowy location . Where is this?: In the opening scene, a desert planet is shown that is not Tatooine, but rather a new place JJ Abrams said was Jaku - it is not known how that is spelled or what lives there . Star Wars Celebration is a multi-day festival produced by Lucasfilm that's dedicated to Star Wars past and present. The most recent event, held in Germany in July 2013, had more than 20,000 attendees. During the panel, JJ talked about his love of the franchise. 'I was 11 years old when Star Wars come out,' he said. 'That moment transported me. It was the first time a movie made me laugh that way.... the film was brilliant and had such heart and the biggest thing for me was that it had such hope. 'Shooting in Abu Dhabi was an incredible thing. Shooting Star Wars is a Western and a fairy tale... shooting in Abu Dhabi was just that,' he added. The stars in real life: Oscar, Daisy and John side by side at the panel . The star in the film: Oscar as a pilot, Daisy as a scavenger and John, who at one point is a Stormtrooper . They then flashed a scene of the team in the desert. 'It's a planet called Jaku, people thought it was Tatooine, but it was Jaku.' He did not explain how Jaku was spelled or where it was. In November the first trailer came out and it lasted only 88 seconds. Opening some 30-years after Return Of The Jedi, the teaser kicked off with British actor Boyega, playing Finn, racing across a desert landscape dressed in full Stormtrooper regalia. A parched, disembodied voice tells us of an 'awakening' and reminds us of the dual energies that are 'the dark side... and the light.' The droids showed up too: Also on stage were the new robot BB-8 (left) and the old robot R2D2 (right), which looked a bit banged up . Behind the scenes: Not only was the trailer shared, but so were shots from the making of the movie . British actress Ridley is the next new star to appear as she drives a hover vehicle towards a desert town, while Oscar Isaac is seen as a fighter pilot, looking rather like a young Luke Skywalker when he's headed for the Death Star. The first trailer also delivered what was initially suggested during the forthcoming film's development - a clear departure from the over-indulgent use of CGI that blighted parts one, two and three of the science fiction saga. It also confirmed the welcome return of the iconic Millennium Falcon, and it is seen dodging laser blasts in a brief battle sequence. A new lightsaber made its debut, complete with a sword-like hilt, as an ominous cloaked figure marauds through a dark, snow-layered forest setting. The film opens December 18, 2015. The man with a plan: JJ Abrams spoke about the exciting project on stage . The veterans: Mark, Carrie and Anthony Daniels waved to the crowd of loyal followers . Dark side: Several Storm Troopers attended the event as they walked in a uniform line while standing in the background at the event . The gang's all here: Several Star Wars diehards posed for snaps together while dressed in their costumes .","Mark and Carrie are reprising their roles as Luke and Leia, respectively, which were introduced in 1977 .

5380,"(CNN) An Asiana Airlines plane overran a runway while landing at Japan's Hiroshima Airport on Tuesday evening, prompting the airport to temporarily close, the Japanese transportation ministry said. Twenty-three people had minor injuries after Flight 162 landed at 8:05 p.m., according to fire department and ministry sources. There were 73 passengers and eight crew members -- including five cabin attendants, two pilots and a maintenance official -- aboard when the flight took off from South Korea's Incheon International Airport at 6:34 p.m. local time, Asiana said in a statement late Tuesday. Authorities are investigating initial reports that the Airbus A320 may have hit an object on the runway during landing, causing damage to the rear of its body and the cover of the engine on the left wing, the ministry said. Video of the scene showed the aircraft's body turned around, with its nose pointing in the direction that the plane had come from. Hiroshima Airport closed because of the incident Tuesday night while fire department officials worked at the scene. Airbus, the plane's manufacturer, is aware of the incident and is working to gather more information, Airbus regional media relations manager Marie Caujolle said.","The plane might have hit an object on the runway, the Japanese transportation ministry says .

7526,"A Massachusetts police department was forced to pay a $500 Bitcoin ransom to hackers who encrypted vital records on their computer network. Tewksbury Police Department came under  attack by criminals who infected their network with a form of Internet malware in December before demanding money to decrypt the files. The program called CryptoLocker infects  through an e-mail and then scrambles the data on the computer. It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier. Tewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in Bitcoinransom . The only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the Boston Globe. 'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could. 'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort' The department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files. Police became aware of the malware infection the following day. Computers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan. It is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer  became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier. CryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. CryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. Computers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads. According to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. When a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency. After this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom. As Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach. 'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier. Tewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of ransomware in the U.S. Similar incidents have occurred involving Swansea Police Department which paid a $750 ransom in November 2013, according to Town Crier. Police in Midlothian, Illinois most recently paid a $500 ransom in January.","Tewksbury Police Department was attacked by criminals who infected their network with  malware program called CryptoLocker .

2312,"A Pennsylvania high school is attracting national media attention for all the wrong reasons after a group of students organized a so-called Anti-Gay Day protest, with future events scheduled. The organizers of the homophobic protest at McGuffey High School in Washington County encouraged anyone who shared their bigoted stance to show support by wearing a flannel shirt to school and writing 'Anti-Gay' on their hands. The event was held last Thursday and students report that openly gay pupils also had Bible verses pined to their lockers and were physically bullied by the so-called protesters. Scroll down for video . A number of the anti-gay protesters proudly shared photos of them wearing flannel shirts on social media platforms such as Instagram . Pupils also wrote 'Anti-Gay' on the hands along with a cross as part of their protests apparantly a reaction to a Day Of Silence events for bullied LBGT students the previous day . 'It hurts me to see how rude and cruel, and some of these people were my friends before this started,' Zoe Johnson told WPXI. She was one of a number of pupils who the previous day had observed the nationally recognized Day Of Silence, an event aimed at drawing attention to gay and lesbian bullying and harassment in schools. As part of their protest, Johnson and the other dozen members of the school's Gay-Straight Alliance had worn black, painted rainbows on their faces, and remained silent for much of the day. Thursday's Anti-Gay Day protest is understood to have been a reaction to the previous day's event. It is estimated that somewhere between 50 and 100 students took part in the Anti-Gay event and many openly shared photos on social media of them dressed in their flannel shirts. 'They had a very silent, respectful day of action, and then they came to school on Thursday to an organized backlash,' Kathy Cameron, chair of the board of directors of the Washington County Gay Straight Alliance, told BuzzFeed. The organizers of the school's anti-gay movement have promised further clothing-related protests this week . 'The instigators, the bullies, seemed to be very proud of their efforts and posted many smiling pictures online.' It is believed the students chose the shirts because they are a common item of clothing found in most wardrobes. The organizers of the anti-gay movement have promised further clothing-related protests this week including wearing orange. Students have also reported seeing a 'lynch list' circulating the school of LBGT students who participated in the Day Of Silence event. Concerned students and parents have called on school authorities to act and Dr. Erica Kolat, superintendent of McGuffey School District, has released a statement. 'Yesterday afternoon, April 16, 2015, allegations of harassment were brought to the attention of our administration. McGuffey School District, along with school police officers, continue to investigate all allegations,' she said. 'We will follow our Student Code of Conduct, and file legal citations, as warranted. We resolve to ensure that all children can grow and learn in a safe, supportive environment free from discrimination.'

1950,"Israeli scholars are furious after new flooring was fitted 'behind their backs' by the Muslim authority in charge of Judaism's holiest site - potentially covering up clues to the location of the 'Lost Ark'. The work at the Dome of the Rock was simply meant to replace carpet, worn away by thousands of pilgrims at the gold-topped shrine, which overlooks old Jerusalem. But when the old carpet was lifted, it revealed previously undocumented ancient floor designs - which could point to where the gold-cased Ark of the Covenant was buried 2,500 years ago. The discovery of the cryptic geometric patterns immediately caught the attention of some researchers, thrilled at the possibility of solving the Indiana Jones-type mystery which touches upon a holy grail for biblical enthusiasts.

Legend: Scholars have suggested the flooring may give a clue as to where the Ark of the Covenant - imagined here in the 1981 Indiana Jones film - is hidden, which Jewish tradition says is buried under the Dome . 'Something is there. I don't know what. But something is hidden there,' said Israeli archaeologist Zachi Dvira, who studies the site. Yet it looks likely it will remain a mystery: scholars did not get the chance to document the designs before workmen began laying the new carpet, paid for by King Abdullah II of Jordan, the country which remains the custodian of the area's Muslim holy sites. It has sparked a war of words between the Waqf, the Muslim authority that administers the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, which includes the Dome of the Rock, and Israeli archaeological authorities, who say the repairs were carried out behind their backs. The scholars also fear the glue being used may permanently damage the floor. Israel's housing minister Uri Ariel, of the nationalist Jewish Home party, waded in to the argument to urge an immediate halt to the work. In an alarmed letter sent to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, he wrote: 'There is no need to elaborate on how important this site is, where every modification, every excavation with heavy equipment can cause irreparable harm to the foundations of the Temple.' Row: The Dome of the Rock is one of the most contentious religious spots in all of Jerusalem, and the argument over the carpet is simply the latest in a long line of battle between Muslim and Jewish groups . Holy: The Dome of the Rock and its hilltop plaza is considered Judaism's holiest spot and Islam's third holiest . But the Waqf reject the accusations. Sheikh Azzam Tamimi, the head of the Waqf, said the work is long overdue and has defiantly proclaimed that he was forbidding any Israeli involvement. 'Our work in Al Aqsa is transparent,' he said. 'We are only putting down carpet and felt. Nothing more, nothing less.' They also deny the work will cause any damage. Jamal Al Quda, a member of a group of Jordanian carpet layers who received Israeli visas for the job,  said it was necessary to affix the base layer of thin dark felt before rolling out the carpet above it. 'It comes off my hand,' he added, rubbing his fingers. Heritage: The Dome is thought to be one of the most interesting archaeological sites in Jerusalem . Finance: This latest work, pictured last Sunday, is being paid for by King Abdullah II of Jordan . This is not the first time tensions have flared over work at the Dome of the Rock. The Dome of the Rock is at the centre of competing claims. Muslims believe it enshrines the large rock slab where Muslim tradition says the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. Meanwhile, Jews believe the rock may be where the holiest part of the two ancient Temples stood as early as about 3,000 years ago — and where religious Jews pray a third Temple will one day be built. Ancient Jewish traditions say the Ark of the Covenant. which contained the Ten Commandments, may have been hidden away in a chamber when the First Jewish Temple was destroyed. The adjacent Western Wall, believed to be one of the last remnants of the Temple complex, is the holiest site where Jews can pray. But Palestinian officials reject Jewish historical ties to the site and the competing claims have been known to spill over into violence. While Jerusalem may be the most excavated city in the world, the Dome and its hilltop plaza are an archaeological goldmine which has never been properly dug because of the political sensitivities surrounding the site, which is considered Judaism's holiest spot and Islam's third holiest. In 1999, the Muslim authorities who administer the site dug an enormous hole 12 metres, or 40 feet, deep as part of construction for an underground prayer area, dumping 10,000 tons of earth in a nearby valley and an east Jerusalem dump. The director of the Israeli Antiquities Authority at the time called it an 'archaeological crime'. For years, Dvira and veteran Israeli archaeologist Gabriel Barkay have been leading a team of archaeologists and volunteers in combing through the dirt for historical finds. The initiative, called the Temple Mount Sifting Project, is conducted under the auspices of the Elad Foundation, a group that also purchases Arab homes in contested parts of East Jerusalem and helps move Jews in. Critics say this nationalist agenda should not mix with archaeology. Israel's state comptroller wrote a scathing report in 2010 about the Muslim authorities' illicit work projects at the compound and Israel's failure at enforcing supervision there. Israeli officials kept the report classified out of concern that its publication could harm the sensitive relationship with Jordan. Tens of thousands of worshippers attend weekly Friday prayers, and the carpets have been replaced before — most recently 12 years ago, at a time of heightened violence when Israeli antiquities officials were granted limited access to the site. Social media: Leaked photos of the work have fuelled this latest argument between the two sides . Past renovation projects were done quietly behind the scenes. Leaked photos posted on social media sites — combined with the political influence of Israeli nationalists monitoring the site — drew extra attention and fuelled the latest controversy. Photos that were leaked to Facebook from the off-limits restoration site showed a number of geometric floor patterns never before documented by archaeologists, said Frankie Snyder, a researcher with the Temple Mount Sifting Project. Some apparently date to when the Crusaders controlled the complex in the 12th century, she said. 'I'm worried about damage of the original floors,' said Barkay, the archaeologist. 'The patterns were never properly documented.' Israel Hasson, the director of the Israeli Antiquities Authority, said once the government body learned about the renovation, it made arrangements with the Waqf to send an archaeologist to document some of the floor patterns, but others already had been covered by the maroon and beige carpeting. 'We got to part of them. We didn't get to it all. I won't ask anyone to pull up the carpets to document it,' Hasson said. 'We will wait for the next opportunity. We're sure to be here over the next 2,000 years.'","Row erupted after mysterious geometric designs discovered under carpet .

8334,"A woman armed with guns and hand grenades was shot dead as she tried to attack Istanbul's police headquarters on Wednesday just a day after a deadly hostage situation in the city. A picture of the red-haired woman lying on the ground with a rifle strapped to her body and a handgun by her side has emerged and television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood. The attack comes a day after Turkish prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz, 46, died in hospital after members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. It is not known who fired the fatal shots. Scroll down for video . Shot dead: A picture of the red-haired woman lying on the ground with a rifle strapped to her body and a handgun by her side has emerged . Police HQ: Television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood . Armed: The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained . 'The Istanbul police headquarters on Vatan street was targeted by rifle fire and a female terrorist was killed in the clash,' the Istanbul governor's office said in a statement today. The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained. Separately, police detained a gunman on Wednesday who entered an Istanbul branch of the ruling AK Party and hung from its window a Turkish flag with the emblem of a sword added. It was not immediately clear whether any of the attacks were linked, but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu warned of the risk of 'provocations' and attempts to cause chaos ahead of June's national election. Today, the grieving family of Mr Kiraz who died after being shot in the head and chest during yesterday's courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul.

She was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol . Plain-clothed police officers block a street leading to the police headquarters in Istanbul on Wednesday April 1 . Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot . Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported. Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded. 'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz. Justice Minister Kenan Ipek said the two members of the DHKP-C who took him hostage had 'held a gun to the nation'. 'We don't see this as an attack on our deceased prosecutor, but on the whole justice system,' he said at a ceremony for Mr Kiraz. 'Our state is powerful enough to track down those behind these lowlifes... The fact these assassins are dead shouldn't put those nefarious and dark forces at ease.' Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Mourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15 . Respects: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (L), the son of killed prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz (C) and Turkish National Assembly President Cemil Cicek (R) stand by Kiraz' coffin in Istanbul . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Defiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyer . Mr Kiraz, a father of two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Police chief Selami Altınok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Shattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shot . The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz. Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut. Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency. In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks. The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head. Standing guard: Members of security forces stand outside the main courthouse in Istanbul during the siege . Horror: The prosecutor was leading an investigation into the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan . Protesters: Turkish police use water cannons to disperse protesters who expressed support for an alleged militant member of the banned leftist group DHKP-C group who took Turkish Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage . Emergency: An ambulance leaves the courthouse after police storm the building. Mr Kiraz was taken to hospital where he died from his injuries . Over: Istanbul Security Chief Selami Altinok, centre-right, and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Orhan Kapici speak to the media outside the main courthouse in Istanbul at the end of the siege . They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office. Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot. In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor. 'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. Gunshots: According to the Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed . Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left . The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan. He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police. Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death. The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul. Innocent: Berkin was on his way to buy bread during anti-government street protests when he was struck in the head by a high-velocity gas canister .

6441,"(CNN)At least 21 people were killed during a shipwreck off the northern coast of Haiti, the country's civil protection directorate told CNN on Thursday. A small boat carrying about 50 migrants left from the area of Le Borgne, west of Cap-Haitien, on Wednesday night. It began to sail toward the island of Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos when it was caught in bad weather, civil protection spokesman Joseph Edgar Celestin said. The vessel hit a reef and sank as it tried to return to shore near Le Borgne. Rescuers, most of them volunteers from the town of Le Borgne and surrounding communities, were dispatched to the scene  and rescued at least 12 people, Celestin said. The search for survivors is ongoing, Celestin added. So far, 11 victims -- eight men and three women -- have been identified, Celestin said. Haiti's government urged migrants not to board clandestine ships and condemned those organizing these illegal journeys.","A small boat carrying about 50 migrants left from the area of Le Borgne, west of Cap-Haitien Wednesday .

4408,"A 90-year-old grandmother will not receive the $41million jackpot she thought she won at an Iowa slot machine after the state supreme court ruled her wining pull was caused by a software error. Pauline McKee thought she hit it big in 2011 when, after putting a penny in the 'Miss Kitty' game at the Isle Hotel Casino in Waterloo, the screen announced she had won a bonus award of $41,797,550.16. But on Friday the Iowa Supreme Court determined McKee, who has thirteen grandchildren, had actually only won $1.85 because of how the symbols had aligned in the game. The unanimous court ruled that the casino did not have to pay McKee because the game's rules stated that the maximum award was $10,000 and that bonus awards were not allowed. Pauline McKee, 90, will not receive the $41million jackpot she thought she won from the slots at the Isle Hotel Casino (pictured) in Waterloo, Iowa after the state supreme court ruled her win came from a software error . 'I had my doubts from the start, because that's a lot of money for a penny machine,' McKee told the Chicago Tribune after the ruling. 'I was hoping to help my children out financially, but it wasn't meant to be.' Justice Edward Mansfield wrote that the game's rules and pay table, which are available for reading on the machine, amount to a contract between the casino and the player. The contract is binding, whether or not the player reads the rules, he said. 'Any message appearing on the screen indicating the patron would receive a $41million bonus was a gratuitous promise,' Mansfield wrote in a ruling that dismissed McKee's lawsuit. 'The casino's failure to pay it could not be challenged as a breach of contract.' Stacey Cormican, one of the casino's attorneys, said the court's decision will ensure fairness in Iowa's large gambling industry. 'Casinos are required to post rules and follow those rules. If either the patrons or casinos could change the rules in the middle of the game, it would be absolutely chaos,' she said. Cormican said the casino could have been forced into bankruptcy if the court had ruled in McKee's favor. A $41 million payout would amount to about half of the gross revenue the casino generated last year. McKee, a widow, was playing the penny slots with her daughter during a family reunion when she thought she won the life-changing bonus. Casino officials investigated the machine after she informed an attendant that she had won the jackpot. The unanimous court ruled that the casino did not have to pay McKee because the rules of the 'Miss Kitty' game (pictured) stated that the maximum award was $10,000 and did not allow for bonus awards . The machine was reviewed by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission and it's hardware and software was analyzed in a laboratory, which discovered the erroneous bonus message. In 2010 Aristocrat Technologies Inc., the game's manufacturer, also warned casinos that the machine's hardware was susceptible to displaying 'legacy bonus' awards that had not actually been won. A sign on the casino's game read that 'malfunction voids all pays and plays'. The casino gave McKee a $10 card to play while she waited during the initial investigation and eventually paid for her family's rooms. McKee sued the casino in 2012 after the commission determined the casino didn't have to pay-out because of the machine's glitch. Her lawyers argued that the casino had an implied contract with the customers to pay whatever number they were awarded on the slot machine, according to the Chicago Tribune. Judge Mansfield found the argument to be 'contrary to precedent and general contract principles,' he wrote. As for McKee, she said she will not be playing the slots at Isle Hotel anytime soon. 'They didn't give me anything except what I had on the machine,' she said. 'If they're not going to give me any money at all, that's terrible.'","Pauline McKee thought she hit it big when she put a penny in an Iowa slot machine and the game announced she won a $41.8m bonus award .

7741,"Two teenage cancer survivors have been left distraught after photographs they posted on Facebook to celebrate getting the all-clear were reported for nudity. Tiffany Williams and Jessica Versey, both 19 and from Chester, Cheshire, became close friends during their treatment and went into remission around the same time. They then took to social media to post images of themselves - including one of Miss Williams’s bald head and another of Miss Versey’s chest scar - but these were reported for being ‘offensive’. Reported for nudity: Tiffany Williams and Jessica Versey, took to social media to post images of themselves – including one of Miss Williams’s bald head (left) and another of Miss Versey’s chest scar (right) Battled through: Tiffany Williams, pictured with Peter Andre, was cleared of Hodgkin lymphoma this month . Shock: The picture Tiffany Williams uploaded (left) was reported by someone on Facebook for 'nudity' Miss Williams was cleared of Hodgkin lymphoma earlier this month and regularly documented her struggle with losing hair during chemotherapy on Facebook. While undergoing treatment she decided to cut off all her hair after choosing against it on many previous occasions - making a ‘ten-minute decision’ that she would get a friend to shave it off. But, telling of what happened next, she said: ‘Feeling proud, I updated my friends on Facebook with the caption “I did it!” - and about two hours later found that someone had reported it for nudity. ‘It didn’t get deleted but I knew it must have been someone I had as a friend. I posted a nice one of me with my make-up on the day after, and that got reported too. Tough: This picture, the first selfie Miss Versey uploaded showing her bald head, was reported for nudity . Survivors: Miss Williams is seen in a photo - not reported to Facebook - revealing she had got the all-clear (left), and Miss Versey's post with the image of her scar which was reported for nudity is also pictured (right) Feeling happy: Miss Versey, who received lifesaving bone marrow treatment from her ten-year-old sister Maisy, said it was 'a massive deal' for her chemotherapy catheter be taken out after her gruelling cancer battle . Joking around: Miss Williams regularly wrote on her struggle with losing hair to chemotherapy on Facebook . ‘All I was doing was trying to help others that might need that little boost to show that no one is different, with or without hair or scars.’ If a user wishes to tell Facebook that they believe a picture is breaching nudity guidelines, he or she can click on ‘options’ under the image and ‘report photo’. The user must then click on ‘nudity’ as the reason for a complaint, before confirming they want to report the image to Facebook. It is then sent to the website’s community operations team in Ireland, who consider every report and make a decision based on Facebook’s community standards. The user whose profile carries the photo will receive a notification to say their image has been reported – but it is only removed if Facebook find it breaches guidelines. And she was further shocked last week when leukaemia sufferer Miss Versey’s photo of the scar left by the removal of her chemotherapy catheter also got reported for nudity. Miss Versey, who received lifesaving bone marrow treatment from her ten-year-old sister Maisy, said it was ‘a massive deal’ for it be taken out after her gruelling cancer battle. She added: ‘Having that taken out was a big thing for me, as it essentially kept me alive for so long. I shared my scar to show people my body was one step further away from cancer. ‘As soon as I put it up it was reported for nudity, then straight away a selfie of my bald head was also reported - the first ever picture I posed with no hair. It really upset me as I didn’t see what the big deal was. 'It’s weird that people find it acceptable to post half-naked pictures but yet people get offended by me sharing my journey with cancer.’ Miss Williams added that she was distraught to know that ‘someone that knows me and Jess gets a kick’ out of reporting the photographs. A spokesman for Facebook said today that it does not comment on individual cases, but referred MailOnline to its community guidelines published online for ‘encouraging respectful behaviour’. The ‘nudity’ section states: ‘We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple. ‘But we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures and other art that depicts nude figures. ‘Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also apply to digitally-created content unless the content is posted for educational, humorous or satirical purposes. 'Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed.' Miss Versey has almost 4,200 friends on Facebook, with 80 of these mutual with Miss Williams.

Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws, The Courier-Mail reports. Mr Morris says he wasn't driving when his Volvo was photographed doing 57km/h in a 50km/h zone last year. But he won't say who was behind the wheel. He has invoked a spousal privilege case from 1817, arguing it's unconstitutional for a Queensland court to fine him when there's evidence he was not the driver. Scroll down for video . Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws . He says he was in a meeting with top judges when the Volvo was snapped, and they are willing to testify that he was with them.

10995,"Suddenly an opportunity. From looking as if a door had been slammed shut on them, Liverpool, unexpectedly, have a chance to kick it back open and capitalise. When Liverpool’s players trudged from the Emirates Stadium pitch, having been pummelled into submission by Arsenal, all hope of a top-four finish looked to have evaporated. Brendan Rodgers, subdued and disconsolate, admitted as much in his post-match debrief. The Rodgers who left London nine days ago is very different, though, to the Rodgers who will step into Anfield’s technical area on Monday, feeling optimistic and satisfied with his lot. He knows Liverpool have been let off the hook and now he wants to see a response. Liverpool's first-team players will be all smiles if they can finish inside the top four and win the FA Cup . Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling arrives at Anfield eight hours ahead of Monday night's match at Anfield . Dejan Lovren will be hoping to keep his place after appearing in Liverpool's win over Blackburn . Jordon Ibe removes a suit from the boot of his car as he begins to prepare for his side's league match . Liverpool are seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester City but have a game in hand on their rivals . Had Manchester City won their games against Crystal Palace and Manchester United, talk of Liverpool being Champions League contenders would have been risible but the implosion at the Etihad Stadium has thrown things wide open. At present, the gap between Liverpool and City is seven points – and, just like last year when the two teams were duelling, Manuel Pellegrini’s side have a significantly better goal difference – but Rodgers will be telling his squad that it is not insurmountable. Given the way City are playing, there are a number of games that could cause them issues on the climb to the line – will Aston Villa and QPR be straightforward? How about Tottenham away? Does Pellegrini retain his squad’s belief? – and now is the moment Liverpool must pounce. In the next seven days, the way Liverpool’s campaign is viewed could be completely transformed. Beat Newcastle and they will believe they can hunt City down; see off Villa at Wembley and they will have a fine chance of winning the FA Cup. Rickie Lambert, pictured making his way into Anfield, has failed to hit the back of the net in his last six games . Reds boss Brendan Rodgers will be hoping his side can get back to winning ways in the Premier League . Sterling and his Liverpool team-mates were left dejected after their 4-1 defeat by Arsenal . So now the question will be asked of Rodgers’ squad: can they ramp up the pressure? There have been occasions this season when they have faltered at crucial moments – think home games against Basle (Champions League), Manchester United (Premier League) – and there can be no repeat. Here lies an opportunity for Raheem Sterling to dispel the furore around his contract saga with some jet-propelled performances, for Daniel Sturridge to remind a wider audience of his goalscoring ability and for Philippe Coutinho to sparkle and shine. Coutinho has won John Terry’s vote to be the player of the year. It was quite a statement from the Chelsea captain but there is little doubt that the Brazilian has the ability to be one of the top draws in the Premier League. These two games should be made for him. If Coutinho starts pulling the strings against Newcastle, Liverpool will get the result that will ensure Manchester City feel their breath on their necks and you would think the wide open spaces of Wembley would be tailor-made for his passing game. Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho helped his side progress to the semi-finals of the FA Cup . Rodgers talks tactics with his coaching staff ahead of his side's Premier League showdown with Newcastle . ‘He is a young player that's come into this country and adapted incredibly well to the style of football in the Premier League,’ said Rodgers. ‘People initially maybe thought he might be a bit slight. But he is very strong in his mind and he’s got an incredible technique, up there with world's best. 'With him it's about the consistency. He played in a different position the other night against Blackburn, we asked him tactically to operate different and he carried that out very, very well. So great tactical discipline and obviously a wonderful goal. ‘His best years are way ahead of him. He's such a humble boy, he wants to train and loves his football every day. John's probably looking at his performance level; since he's been here it has been outstanding and is only going to get better which is the pleasing thing for everyone.’ Rodgers’ ambition all year has been to win a trophy. If he was also to steer Liverpool into a top-four spot, it would arguably represent an even better campaign than last year when they came within two points of ending their 25-year quest to become champions of England. To realise that ambition, however, Rodgers needs two wins. A door has been left ajar and Coutinho is the man to lead Liverpool through it.","Liverpool got back to winning ways with FA Cup victory over Blackburn .

Paul Bakewell, 35, from Walsall, West Mids, secretly designed a poster which he then had emblazoned on the 20ft-tall advertising hoarding and covered over. The dad-of-one arranged for his partner Tara Barber, 32, to be driven past the billboard by her boss who pretended they were going to a business meeting on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Paul Bakewell, 35, proposed to partner Tara Barber, 32, by asking her to marry him using a giant billboard on the A34, in Walsall, West Mids . Hairdresser Tara (pictured left), was shocked when her car pulled up to the billboard and her partner, gas fitter Paul (pictured right) got down on one knee . 'Tara, you've changed my life. Will you marry me?': The billboard was 20ft-tall and 30ft-wide and also featured pictures of the couple . But the pretty hairdresser was left speechless when the car stopped at the 30ft-wide poster on the side of the A34 in Walsall, West Mids. The billboard featured pictures of the couple and the words: 'Tara you've changed my life. Will you marry me?' Romantic Paul - who had arranged for friends and family to hide on the other side of the road - then went down on one knee and proposed to Tara, who said yes. Gas fitter Paul, who lives with Tara in Walsall, said he didn't sleep for two days because of nerves from planning the big surprise. Paul left the house at 4am on Friday to help put the poster on the giant billboard - telling Tara he had been called out to an emergency gas leak . Surprise!

I was putting myself out there in front of so many people but I was confident she would say yes. 'I have never been so nervous in my life planning this. It was completely nerve-wracking, I hadn't slept for two days before Friday. 'I had been to ask her dad first to do it the traditional way and her family said she would say yes. 'I'm from just down the road and I know Tara drives this way into work in Walsall every day so I arranged for her boss to drive her there pretending they had a meeting. 'When she arrived she was so shocked and I think more nervous than me when she realised what was happening. 'She didn't have a clue. I thought it would be something special to make a grand gesture.' The 20ft-tall 30ft-wide billboard featured images of the couple from their relationship . The billboard was positioned on the side of major road, the A34 in Walsall, West Mids, a route that Tara regularly takes to work . 'I wanted to do something different. Anyone can propose at a table at a restaurant or at home but I wanted it to be something she would remember.' Mother-of-one Tara, who has a son Carrick, six, from a previous relationship, added: 'I was totally clueless, it was the best kept secret. 'My boss pulled over and I thought there had been a car accident because there were so many people by the side of the road. 'Then she started crying and I saw the billboard and my legs just went to jelly, I couldn't feel them at all. 'I had no hesitation to saying yes. It was incredible, we'll never forget this.

1675,"Shelly Sterling has spoken out about her legal victory over her husband's alleged mistress V. Stiviano, saying she took the much-younger woman to court 'for justice'. The billionaire wife of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling said she felt vindicated by the judge's ruling this week that Stiviano, 32, must return $2.6 million in sugar daddy gifts. Donald Sterling, 80, had lavished his alleged girlfriend with gifts including a $1.8 million house, luxury cars and stocks - all while hiding them from his wife of six decades. But Shelly insisted on Wednesday she didn't take them to court over the money. Scroll down for video . Vindicated: Shelly Sterling, pictured at a Clippers game last month, will receive $2.6 million from a woman her husband Donald showered with gifts. Shelly has said she took the woman to court 'for justice' 'I did it for justice,' she said. 'I think when somebody harms you in so many ways, justice has to prevail.' Shelly Sterling said she would donate the proceeds to charity. Despite acknowledging marital problems, she also said she and her husband never separated. She said she drafted divorce papers last year, but never filed them. The couple testified at trial last month in Los Angeles Superior Court about their love for each other, displaying cards they had exchanged. Still, Donald Sterling is suing his wife and the NBA over the $2 billion sale of the team. A year ago, a recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to associate with black people led the NBA to ban him for life and fine him $2.5 million. His wife then negotiated a deal to sell the team with ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer after doctors found Donald Sterling incompetent to handle his business affairs. Together: Donald Sterling is pictured with V. Stiviano in 2011 as they watch the Clippers play. He lost the team last year after a recording emerged in which he told Stiviano not to be seen with black people . Shelly added on Wednesday that she mourns the loss of the team. 'It was a horrible thing to go through,' she said. 'They were like my family. To this day I still feel very bad about it.' Her husband's lawyer on Wednesday criticized her lawsuit as a 'pet project' that had extended Stiviano's time in the spotlight. 'The sums spent by Shelly Sterling in pursuing this matter likely exceeds any amount that will be recovered,' attorney Bobby Samini said. 'We remain perplexed that so much time, energy and money have been allocated to litigating with Ms. Stiviano.' Shelly Sterling's attorney scoffed at that statement. 'What do you expect from the lawyer for a husband who was caught red-handed gifting his mistress with millions of dollars of family money,' Pierce O'Donnell said. In court: Stiviano, pictured heading to court last month, accepted gifts worth $2.6 million from the older man and has now been ordered to hand them back over. The exact nature of their relationship was never clear . Shelly Sterling had filed the suit against Stiviano a month before the recording of her husband telling Stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the NBA to ban him for life. In court, Shelly Sterling's lawyers used other recordings from Stivian's iPhone to show he bought his alleged mistress a house, a Ferrari and other things. Stiviano and the 80-year-old billionaire were heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife. 'The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,' Stiviano said in snippet played in court. During the course of their two and a half years together, Sterling gave her a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex. Sterling testified that he paid for the house, though Stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer. But Judge Richard Fruin Jr. said this claim was 'not believable' and he relied instead on a recording in which she told Donald Sterling: 'I want Shelly to know you bought me the house.' Still smiling: Stiviano, pictured showing off her new braces, was seen out in Los Angeles earlier this month . He ruled earlier this week that Stiviano must now turn over the keys to the $1.8 million house and pay Shelly Sterling some $800,000 that her husband showered on the younger woman in gifts. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers games. In the subsequent furor, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2 billion. The recording was leaked weeks after Shelly Sterling sued Stiviano, alleging she was her husband's mistress but the exact nature of their relationship was never clear. Stiviano called him a lover and father figure but said they never had sex. Donald Sterling called her an 'ex-friend' on the witness stand, though he said in recordings that he loved her and wanted to give her everything.","A Los Angeles judge ruled this week that V.

10957,"Wanted: Police in Maryland have issued a warrant for the arrest of 26-year-old karate instructor Alexander Soumbadze who has been charged with eight counts of child pornography . Police in Maryland have launched a manhunt for a 26-year-old karate instructor who has been charged with possessing child pornography. The Montgomery County Police Department said Friday that Alexander Soumbadze faces eight possession of child pornography counts. Soumbadze has recently admitted to trading and receiving child pornography, after which police say the Georgian national fled the country. An investigation also uncovered videos of the martial arts expert inappropriately touching and engaging in sexual acts with adolescent males at a Maryland karate studio where he was co-owner and instructor. Officials say the videos were taken before October 2011 and that they are attempting to locate victims to determine possible additional charges. According to Montgomery County police, the 26-year-old, a native of Tbilisi, Georgia, fled the US after confessing to the crimes. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the Bethesda resident. According to a press release put out by the Montgomery County police Friday, in December 2014, the agency was tipped off by colleagues in South Dakota that a Maryland resident was uploading child pornography. Vile acts: Police have recovered videos showing the martial arts teacher (far right) molesting boys at the On The Mat Sports International in Chevy Chase, formerly known as DC Martial Arts . Fugitive: The Tbilisi, Georgia, native admitted to trading child pornography videos earlier this month. Two days after his interview with police, he fled, possibly returning to his native country . Armed with court orders, detectives in Maryland were able to obtain subscription information corresponding to the suspect, which led them to Soumbadze. On April 1, 2015, police executed a search warrant at Soumbadze’s home in Bethesda, seizing several electronic devices that yielded eight pornographic videos featuring children. Other recordings recovered by police allegedly showed the suspect molesting boys at his karate studio on Wisconsin Avenue in Chevy Chase. Soumbadze has been affiliated with the On The Mat Sports International karate studio, formerly known as DC Martial Arts, since he was a young child and took classes there as a martial arts student. During an interview with police, the 26-year-old sensei admitted to trading and receiving child porn. Close ties: Soumbadze has been affiliated with karate studio (pictured) since he was a young child and took classes there as a martial arts student . Two days after Soumbadze was questioned by police, he fled the country, possibly returning to his native Georgia. Police spokeswoman Rebecca Innocenti told Bethesda Magazine that Georgia has an extradition treaty with the US, but their goal now is to complete the investigation and identify the victims in the videos before setting the diplomatic process in motion. In a profile of the On the Mat studio in February, Soumbadze told BethesdaNow.com that his parents, both Georgian diplomats, brought him to the US when he was 5 years old. He graduated from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in 2006.","Arrest warrant has been issued for Alex Soumbadze, 26, a karate instructor from Bethesda, Maryland .

In the seventh innings of a game between the Kansas City Royals and rivals Chicago White Sox both sets of players became embroiled in a mass brawl. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight at Chicago's US Cellular Field in Illinois. Scroll down for video . Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija, center, in the brawl with Royals players during Thursday's game . A heated exchange between Royals starter Yordano Ventura and White Sox outfielder Adam Eaton sparked the brawl which saw players from both dugouts and bullpens flood the field, reported New York Daily News. Several punches were thrown and  Ventura, along with fellow teammates Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez, was sent off along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija. Thursday's match began to get scrappy after the White Sox's Jose Abreu was hit in the arm by  Ventura's pitch in the fourth innings. The very next innings, Royals' Mike Moustakas was also hit in the arm, this time by a pitch from Chris Sale, leading to a warning for both teams. But things continued to escalate until Eaton hit a comebacker (a ball batted directly back to the pitcher) at Ventura in the seventh innings. The Royals starter picked up a ground ball but instead of throwing it to first for the out, he appeared to stop for a moment and stare at the pitcher. MLB.com . Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . The pair exchanged words, and Eaton is alleged to have shouted an expletive at Ventura, who was said to have shouted one back before he threw to first base to end the inning. Things quickly turned ugly and both players had to be kept apart by teammates and umpires. But the whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches. The fight was beginning to calm down and Moustakas was escorting Ventura back to the dugout when Samardzija charged at Cain. However, he missed knocked over coach Mike Jirschele instead. Ventura told ESPN Chicago he regretted the way he'd handled himself. 'It was a messy situation, I got the ground ball and was unable to control my emotions in that play, and it turned out ugly,' Ventura said. Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected . Both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches . '(Eaton) said something to me. I responded back to him,' he said. 'It wasn't my intention, but maybe he interpreted it from the way I fielded the ball, but it was a hard comebacker, kind of put me off-balance, at which point I took those steps that incited him and he responded back, clearly emotional.' Royals won the game 3-2 in 13 innings, which is the first of a four-game series. This is not the first time the Royals have had tensions with other teams. Last weekend, their clash with Oakland Athletics landed scrappy Ventura with a fine for his actions. He was also  involved in the team's disagreements with the Los Angeles Angels. In the three-game series against the Athletics, the teams clashed almost every match until five players and coaches were thrown out of the finale. They included Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera, who threw that fastball behind the head of Brett  Lawrie and pointed to his own head in a threatening manner. He received a five-game suspension.","Thursday's match between  two baseball heavyweights turned into a brawl .

1678,"(CNN)A professor at Texas A&M Galveston said in an email to his strategic management students that they were a disgrace, that they lacked maturity -- and that he would fail the entire class. Irwin Horwitz, an instructional associate professor in the university's department of maritime administration, told CNN affiliate KPRC that he had finally reached a breaking point. ""Enough was enough,"" Horwitz said. ""It became apparent that they couldn't do just some of the most simple and basic things that they should've been able to do at that point."" In the email to students, KPRC reported, Horwitz said: ""I have seen cheating, been told by students to 'chill out,' 'get out of my space,' 'go back and teach' refuse to leave the room after being told to do so following inappropriate conduct, called a 'f*****g moron' several times by a student to my face..."" Horwitz added that students spread hurtful rumors about him, his wife and colleagues, and that he felt the need for police protection in class. John Shaw, a senior at Texas A&M Galveston and student in Horwitz's class, told KPRC he was worried about the job he has lined up after graduation. ""Just ridiculous, because, I mean, I had never had a problem in the class,"" Shaw said. ""I thought I had done pretty well, done pretty well on the first test and everything else that's going on. I get an email saying I am going to get an F in the class, and just kind of -- it was overwhelming."" Texas A&M Galveston is a part of the Texas A&M University System; its more than 2,000 students focus on marine and maritime studies. Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer, told KPRC that the university will not necessarily stand by the failing grades Horwitz planned to hand out. University officials said the department head will take over teaching the strategic management class. ""None of them have failed until the end of the class, meaning the only reason a student would fail is because he or she hasn't performed the actual, you know, with the expectations for that particular class,"" Louchouarn said. University officials have not yet responded to CNN's request for comment.","A Texas A&M Galveston professor said in an email to students he would fail the entire class .

4977,"It's the festival that fashion forgot - and this weekend celebrities were leading the bad-taste brigade at Coachella. Revellers at the arts and music extravaganza in the Californian desert are known for their 'out there' outfit choices but this year festival-goers wore ever more outlandish looks. Yet even among the acres of exposed flesh, lame pieces, mesh maxi dresses, skintight patterned leggings and leotards, a few stars'  dubious style still managed to stand out. Scroll down for video . Another pair are trussed up in neon tutus and floral-adorned bras . One man decided to ditch all the outfit-choosing hassle and simply dressed up as a mummy, wearing a full bodysuit in the scorching sun . Neon swimming hats were among some of the colourful outfits on display at Coachella this weekend . Jaden Smith, 16, wore a floral-print tunic that seemed to resemble a tiered dress . Will Smith's son Jaden Smith, 16, was spotted in a floral-print tunic worn over, what looked like a wrap around skirt.

While pal Kylie Jenner was photographed in nude-coloured hot pants - which looked like they came from brother-in-law Kanye West's latest catwalk show - and hiking boots, and later a bizarre black lace body stocking, with festival-inappropriate lace-up heels. The teen also sported an array of out-there hair choices: first opting for a shocking cotton-candy shade, and later her signature jet-black hair in sections of gothic silver plaits.

Paris Hilton, who is often pictured wearing a maxi dress, went for a busy blue version with a deep V-neck that almost dipped to her navel. But her accessories were the real fashion faux pas and included sunglasses with rose gold details at each corner and a pair of embellished cat ears. Khloe Kardashian showed her commitment to the new fringing trend in an an all-white skin-tight dress with a dangerously high thigh-split and matching jacket with heavily fringed sleeves. Singer Katy Perry went for a demure look in a tent-like rose coloured layered dress, which she wore with a thick tribal neckpiece.

But while most of the famous festival-goers committed crimes to fashion, they looked positively demure compared with their fellow merrymakers. It seemed neon was very much the obsession of the weekend, with many people turning up in an array of bright tiny outfits and accessories, including flower-adorned swimming caps and tutus. One man, who looked slightly worse for wear, sported a thigh-skimming Peter Pan costume, no shoes and muddy feet, with a child's Wellington boot around his neck as a necklace. Others sported brash prints with clashing headgear, and women - and men - showed an abundance of skin in painfully-tight shorts. One woman paired a Vietnamese traditional hat, as well as an oriental fan with a body suit and a completely sheer maxi-skirt.

9217,"Louis Jordan, 37, released a three-paragraph statement on Monday in which he said he stayed inside his cabin to keep dry and avoid sun, wind, waves and sea spray during his ordeal. The man rescued from a disabled sailboat off the North Carolina coast has responded to critics of his story by claiming that he avoided sunburn and blisters by staying in the vessel's cabin and that he survived by rationing food and water. Louis Lordan released a three-paragraph statement on Monday in whcih he said he stayed inside the cabin to keep dry and avoid sun, wind, waves and sea spray. 'Every time I went outside, I exposed myself to getting my clothes drenched, which would have made it harder for me to keep warm,' Jordan said. 'My blankets were already soaked, and often there was no way of hanging up my clothes to dry. Keeping dry was vital to my survival.' Jordan also said he set up a makeshift mast with a small sail to get the boat headed in a westward direction. He said he rationed food and water and kept his calorie expenditure low. 'That meant I had to stay inside the boat as much as possible, therefore I didn't have a sunburn, or blisters, as if I were found clinging to an upside-down boat,' Jordan said. Jordan was spotted by a German-flagged boat on Thursday, more than two months after sailing out of a South Carolina marina. Coast Guard crew members who retrieved him said they were surprised by his fit appearance and overall health. Too good to be true? A surprisingly healthy-looking Louis Jordan pictured soon after  being found off the North Carolina coast on Thursday . Thomas Grenz, the captain of the German tanker ship that spotted Jordan last week and brought him aboard, said Jordan's U.S. passport described him as weighing 290 pounds, but he was probably down to 200 pounds when the crew found him. Officials with the U.S. Coast Guard say it wasn't clear how long after he left the marina in Conway, South Carolina, that his boat first capsized. Jordan's sailboat was upright when the German boat found him. Jordan told his family that he was going into open water to sail and fish, according to his mother, Norma Davis. He told WAVY-TV that he was sailing north when he encountered bad weather. He said he saw a wave crash into his window and that his boat eventually filled with water. The Coast Guard began a search on Feb. 8, but it was abandoned after 10 days. Some sightings of Jordan were reported by other sailors, but they couldn't be confirmed. Jordan's statement thanked the Coast Guard rescuer who dropped down from the helicopter to lift Jordan off the boat. He also thanked Grenz and his crew for turning their ship around to save him. Jordan was spotted by a German-flagged boat on Thursday, more than two months after sailing out of a South Carolina marina. Coast Guard crew members who retrieved him said they were surprised by his fit appearance and overall health .

God is truly great.'","Louis Jordan, 37, released a three-paragraph statement on Monday in a bid to answer critics suspicious of his amazing survival story .

9977,"From now on there will be a lot less facebook photos with people cuddling up to tigers on their Thailand holidays. The famous Tiger Temple just outside of Bangkok, popular with tourists for being able to interact with the big cats, has been forced to shut due to keeping the animals without permits. Wat Pa Luangta Bua Yanasampanno has been told that their 147 tigers must be handed over to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation by Friday or they will be seized. The news will no doubt please animal rights activists who have been campaigning against the mistreatment of the big cats at the sanctuary. End of Tiger Temple! The temple, just outside of Bangkok, has been told all animals must be handed over by Friday as the monks do not have permits for them . The Bangkok Post reported that the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation's Department Chief, Nipon Chotiban, had issued the closure following a raid in February. The investigation was launched following multiple complaints of trafficking endangered species, illegally selling animals and possible mistreatment of the animals. Although the results of the raid have not revealed to the public, the chief has said the temple did not have permits for the cats. Chotiban says that the tigers are to be moved to the Khao Pra Thap Chang Wildlife Breeding Centre in Chom Bung district and Khao Son Wildlife Breeding Centre in Suan Phung district in Ratchaburi province. Animal rights activists have been complaining against the treatment of the tigers for years . The carnivores at the temple are hand-raised from an early age by monks in an attempt to control their aggressive behaviour . Having a picture with tigers is a popular tourist attraction at the Kanchanaburi  sanctuary . Thai Visa News reported the Wildlife Conservation Office director, Tuanjai Nujdamrong, said: 'As Wat Pa Luang Ta Bua does not have proper cages and clear animal nurturing facilities, we can see that the temple has no intention to open as a public zoo. 'Therefore, they did not receive a reply when they sought a licence extension from the department and their [former] licence is no longer valid.' The tiger sanctuary, ran by Buddhist monks, has been open near Kanchanaburi since 1994. It has been shrouded by controversy and numerous complaints about the treatment of the chained up tigers. The tigers will be rehoused at the Khao Pra Thap Chang Wildlife Breeding Centre in Chom Bung  and Khao Son Wildlife Breeding Centre in Ratchaburi province .

Adele Berry, of Reddish, Greater Manchester, spoke to the call handler when she contacted the mobile phone company over a problem with her bill.

Adele Berry has told of her shock after she was bombarded with texts from a Vodafone call centre worker . Ms Berry was put through to a call centre in South Africa when she phoned the company over the issue last month. She says she made small talk with the man who answered the query to fill 'dead air', but did nothing to suggest she was interested in him. The 21-year-old was stunned when she later received a string of messages from the man, who said his name is 'Miguel'. In one text, the man referred to himself as her 'future hubby' and promised to buy her shoes when he met her. He also sent her a picture of himself in one message, and told her: 'Wow I knew you beautiful but damn you are super beautiful.' After asking how 'his in-laws' were, he said: 'I'm hope I'm not being too, how can I say, forward.' The man repeatedly sent Ms Berry messages featuring photos of himself and kissing emoticons . The man has sent her 18 messages since she made the call, some of which have referred to his family in Liverpool, making Ms Berry fear he may try to approach her. She told the Manchester Evening News: 'It is quite scary, it is quite distressing. He won't leave me alone. Being pestered by someone I don't know gets me quite nervous.' The man has now been suspended by Vodafone, which says it has a number of call centres in the UK but also sends some callers through to their office in South Africa.

4333,"A police crime commissioner is facing investigation after awarding more than half a million pounds of taxpayers' money to the charity she runs alongside the force's chief. Vera Baird donated £500,000 to Victims First Northumbria, a charity which supports crime victims in her area and of which she is a director. Sitting alongside her on the organisation's top table is Sue Sim, Northumbria's Chief Constable, records revealed. The pair now face a Ministry of Justice probe as critics accuse them of concocting 'a soap opera' within the force. Vera Baird, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, faces a Ministry of Justice investigation after allocating more than £500,00 of public money to a charity of which she is the director . Sitting alongside Ms Baird on Victims First Northumbria's top table is Chief Constable Sue Sim. The pair are pictured together, above . It comes after the Home Secretary implemented a rule allowing PCCs to commission services for victims of crime. Last month Ms Baird boasted of the securing of funds for the charity in an article on its website. 'From April 1, I become responsible for some victims’ services after funding was devolved by the Ministry of Justice to PCCs,' she wrote. A Northumbria Police spokesman said the funds would be allocated 'in the same manner that Victim Support were directly funded by the MOJ'. But critics have described her selection of charity as 'inappropriate' and a conflict of interest. Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs committee, said: 'Northumbria police appears to have developed its own soap opera. 'It is totally inappropriate for a PCC to set up any organisation in which they have an interest of whatever kind using public money.' In an article on the charity's website, Ms Baird boasted of securing the funds from the public purse last month . Mrs Sim shot to prominence within the force over her handling of the hunt for Raoul Moat in 2010. She is pictured above with Deputy Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson at a press conference following his death . Adding the fact that Chief Constable Sue Sim was 'wrong', Mr Vaz said commissioners should never have been given the ability to allocate public funds to charity. 'The Home Secretary should never have given these powers.' Ms Baird stood by her decision today, telling MailOnline: 'All Ministry of Justice procedures and protocols were adhered to. Keith Vaz accused the force of creating its own 'soap opera' 'I am confident the team of coordinators will show that the decisions taken to create Victims First Northumbria were the right ones.' Mrs Sim has already announced that she will be retiring from the force in June. She was previously accused of bullying staff and faced an investigation that was spearheaded by Ms Baird, her co-director at Victims First Northumbria. A Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed it would investigate the circumstances to conclude whether any conflict of interest rules had been broken. 'The MoJ requires PCCs not to be subject to conflicts of interest when providing victims services and has the power to investigate any possible conflict of interest and to cease funding if such a conflict is established.' Victims First Northumbria was established after the number of people contacting its predecessor, Victim Support, plummeted. But sources say many may be reluctant to confide in a service that is partly run by Mrs Sim who faced misconduct proceedings over alleged workplace bullying before announcing her retirement last week. The police chief who shot to prominence after her handling of the Raoul Moat manhunt in 2010, said she was stepping down to spend more time with her family. Ms Baird praised her 'passion and enthusiasm', adding: 'Sue and I have worked well together over the two-and-a-half years since I became police and crime commissioner.'","Vera Baird has allocated £500,000 to be given to Victims First Northumbria .

Karen Buckley, 24, disappeared from the Glasgow club in the early hours of Sunday morning without collecting her coat after telling friends she was going to the loo. CCTV cameras filmed her talking to a man outside the club before getting into his car and travelling to his flat in nearby Kelvindale . But fears over the Irish student’s safety were heightened yesterday after police revealed they had tracked down the man and he is not being treated as a suspect. Scroll down for video . Karen Buckley, 24, (left) pictured with friends on the night she went missing after leaving a Glasgow nightclub . Karen Buckley, a student at Glasgow Caledonia University,  has been missing since Sunday after going out with friends . Miss Buckley, who is brunette and 5ft 2in, was wearing a black jumpsuit and red heels when she was last seen leaving the man’s flat in Kelvindale at around 4am. A handbag thought to belong to her was found in a park near the man’s home yesterday, causing police to say they are ‘gravely concerned’ about her safety. The family of Miss Buckley, who is from Cork in the Republic of Ireland, have flown to Scotland to help with the search for the Glasgow Caldeonian University student, who studies occupational therapy. Her mother Marion told a press conference in Glasgow: 'We just want Karen home safely, we are desperate. She is our only daughter, we love her dearly.

We are desperate to get her back and safe with her family - she is our only daughter, we love her dearly and just want her to come home safe and sound. 'She always keeps in contact with her family and friends to let them know where she is and what she is up to. 'To not return to her flat or be in contact with her pals - not responding to texts and calls to her mobile is very, very worrying as it is so out of character.' Miss Buckley arrived at the Sanctuary club with friends at around 11.45pm on Saturday and at around 1am she told them she was going to the toilet. She failed to return and did not take her jacket. She was then seen outside on CCTV talking to a man and then walking west along Dumbarton Road towards Church Street. Friends then raised the alarm on Sunday, saying it was 'very out of character' for her not to return home.

Detective Superintendent Jim Kerr, from Police Scotland's major investigations teams, stressed that the male was 'not a suspect.' He told the press conference: We've traced the man she was with in Dorchester Avenue. He believes he was intimate with her at his flat consensually in the early hours of Sunday. 'From what we can see, she does not appear to be under duress, there's no signs of a struggle or reluctance on her part to leave the club. 'However, that does not mean that something untoward has happened to her at a later stage. 'There was talk of another man she had been seen with. We've also traced him, we've spoken to him.' Police comb through trees in Kelvingrove Park below the tower of Glasgow University in the search for Miss Buckley . Police say there has been no activity on Miss Buckley's social media accounts and say that they have recovered her handbag . Miss Buckley, who has three older brothers, is described as white and around five to five foot two inches tall with brown eyes and dark hair which had long black curly extensions in it. When last seen, she was wearing a black jumpsuit with red high-heeled shoes and was carrying a black handbag. She also speaks with an Irish accent. Miss Buckley lives with three other student friends and earlier on Saturday evening had drinks with them in their flat before going to the night club, although her friends told police she was not drunk.

The gang of four were seen trying to hack into an ATM outside a Waitrose supermarket in Kenilworth in Warwickshire, before they fled police in the stolen car after nearby residents reported seeing sparks flying from the cash machine. When they were arrested at a flat in Tamworth a list of ATMs was found. The thieves were caught after a police helicopter followed the gang of four as they tore up the northbound carriageway of the M42 in the stolen car. They were tracked to a block of flats in Tamworth in Staffordshire. Scroll down for video . Police tracked the masked gang as they fled the scene of the attempted raid in a stolen Audi RS7 (circled) after they had spent around eight minutes trying to hack into an ATM outside a Waitrose supermarket . The group reached speeds of 145mph in the stolen car as they headed towards flats in Tamworth . Members of the gang used a circular saw, crowbars and a hydraulic cutter - known as an angle grinder - usually used by firefighters to rescue people from car crashes. They spent eight minutes trying to access the vault - causing £20,000 of damage - before speeding off in a stolen Audi RS7 at 3.20am on September 29 last year. The Audi had been stolen from a house in Bicester in Oxon on September 10 in a bid to shake off officers in a chase to the Tamworth apartment. Gang members Mark Kirk, 34, Pedro Taylor, 30, and Jason Hadley, 27, were then found hiding in the Tamworth apartment and arrested. Dean Beech (left) and Mark Kirk (right) were jailed after they worked as part of the four-strong gang . Pedro Taylor (left) and Jason Hadley (right) were also part of the gang of four, who were wearing masks . Driver Dean Beech, 37, reached speeds of over 145mph in the stolen Audi. He was found by police dog handlers hiding in dense bushes close to the flat after being detected by helicopter thermal imaging cameras. The gang all admitted conspiracy to steal and aggravated vehicle taking, and have been jailed. After the hearing, police released video footage showing the foursome accelerating away from chasing police cars whose on-board cameras show them reaching a top speed of 145mph. The gang caused around £20,000 worth of damage as they tried to hack into the Waitrose cashpoint . The two minute video then shows the gang fleeing on foot after ditching their car at the flats in footage taken from the helicopter's thermal imaging camera. Police can also be seen surrounding Beech as he is arrested in nearby bushes before an officer in the helicopter says: 'Cracking job, I'm ready for a cup of tea, back to base.' When officers forced their way into the flats they found Kirk inside, who claimed to have been asleep with his girlfriend all night. Hadley and Taylor were also dressed all in black standing in the kitchen whilst Beech was arrested hiding in bushes outside. Police found cutting equipment in the Audi's boot alongside its original number plate, while a search of the flat uncovered an address list of shops with cash points. Detectives discovered the sole of Beech's ZX750 Adidas trainers, plus footwear worn by Taylor and Kirk, matched imprints left in the angle grinder dust next to the shattered ATM. Taylor and Hadley, both of no fixed address, were given three-year in jail for their part in the Kenilworth ATM theft attempt. Beech, of no fixed address, and Kirk had been on bail at the time of the botched ATM raid for plotting to rob a jeweller in Birmingham on August 1, 2013. Officers from West Midlands Police's Serious and Organised Crime Unit had lain in wait for the pair at the Jewellery Quarter after their plan to turn up wearing balaclavas and gloves. The pair, along with accomplice Darren Bowman, 47, were stopped moments before their intended raid by officers who had followed them for a month and punctured the tyres of their getaway car on the day of the planned robbery. Beech was jailed for a total of 12 years - two for the cashpoint attack, and another 10 for conspiracy to rob the jewellers. The stolen Audi is seen parked up as the thieves drove to Tamworth and then escaped from the car inside . Kirk, of Birmingham, was given a sentence of 11 years - 18 months for his role in the cash point raid, as well as 10 years for the jewellery plot. Bowman, of Moseley, Birmingham was jailed for six years and two montha after being convicted of the conspiracy to commit robbery charge. The court heard the night before the planned raid, Beech and Kirk had stolen a Toyota Land cruiser from Middleton, near Tamworth, Staffs. It was then fitted with false plates and driven to Birmingham in convoy with Beech's van, which was dumped in Erdington near the city centre.

The two men parked in the Jewellery Quarter just before 11am to wait for the jeweller but armed officers quickly surrounded the car and arrested them. Bowman was then arrested a few weeks later. Just a month later Kirk and Beech went on to try and break into the Waitrose ATM. Speaking after the hearing, West Midlands Police traffic officer Mitch Darby, who was involved in the pursuit, said: 'The police helicopter picked up the Audi near Hampton-in-Arden before we spotted it heading north on the M42. Officers swooped in on the gang and made their way into the Tamworth apartment where they arrested them . Police were also able to arrest Dean Beech who had hid himself in the bushes but was seen on the cameras . 'We were trying to keep pace but even at 140mph they were pulling away but they can't outrun the police helicopter. 'Camera operators on-board gave us a continual commentary of the car's movements and directed us to the flats where they tried hiding. 'Colleagues and police dogs quickly had a solid containment of the houses to make sure no-one could leave and it was only a matter of time before we arrested the offenders.'","Four masked raiders used saws and an angle grinder to break into an ATM .

3223,"England must decide whether to stick with the attack that failed to force a first Test win or twist and freshen things up for a second match that is already upon them. The sight of Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood impressing in the nets here on Sunday, and Moeen Ali bowling apparently without discomfort after joining the squad, was a reminder that England have options for the second Test which starts on Tuesday. It would be harsh to blame the bowlers for their inability to take the eight wickets they needed on the final day of the Antigua Test because they threw everything at West Indies on a pitch that refused to deteriorate. Liam Plunkett, pictured with Chris Jordan, is pushing for a place in England's attack for the second Test . Mark Wood (pictured) and Plunkett impressed in the nets on Sunday ahead of the second match of the series . Yet there is no doubting that they were missing an X-factor, with strike bowlers Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad down on pace and England refusing to gamble on the inconsistent leg-spin of Adil Rashid. Chris Jordan was the fastest bowler in the first Test, clocked at 91mph, and while it would be a huge surprise if England dropped either Anderson or Broad, there is a case for Plunkett or the impressive Wood to feature. ‘Over the next 12 months we are going to need a squad of bowlers who can win us Test matches,’ said vice-captain Ian Bell after England’s first look at the National Stadium here. ‘Both Wood and Plunkett are bowling with really good pace and that’s important with so many Test matches to come.’ Moeen Ali has joined up with the England squad after missing the first Test in Antigua through injury . Moeen provides an option for the England selectors while Jonathan Trott appeared in good spirits on Sunday . If Moeen convinces England he is fully fit after recovering from a side injury he will probably replace James Tredwell, who took five wickets in the first Test but is now nursing a shoulder injury. That would add even more depth to an England middle order who all contributed in Antigua, with either Moeen, Ben Stokes or Jos Buttler batting as low as eight on the spice island. Meanwhile, forme rAustralia captain Steve Waugh has urged the ECB to end the ‘circus’ surrounding Kevin Pietersen’s potential England recall. Waugh said Pietersen, who was dismissed for 19 in Surrey’s first innings against Glamorgan yesterday, is ‘no longer a great player’ and does not deserve to play in this summer’s Ashes series. ‘It’s all chaotic,’ said Waugh. ‘The ECB have got to clear it up. Just make the decision and stop messing around because you’re creating a circus which is distracting everybody else.’","Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood both impressed in the nets on Sunday .

The smitten couple were holidaying in Japan and were out for a walk one evening when Bass mentioned how the beautiful setting among the cherry blossom trees would be perfect for a proposal, Sullivan, 29, told Woman's Day. The sporting hero has won two silver Olympic medals and a number of gold and bronze at the Commonwealth games. 'We were walking one night and came across a lone tree in full bloom, complete with white doves,' he told the magazine. Scroll down for video . Former Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan and girlfriend Naomi Bass recently got engaged on a trip to Japan . The couple met in Perth in 2011, and Sullivan proposed to Bass beneath a cherry blossom tree in Kyoto . 'Naomi said ""Gee this is so romantic; it would be a good spot for someone to propose"". So i dropped to one knee and asked her to marry me,' the former swimmer revealed. Sullivan said he had planned to pop the question on that trip, but not until a few days later. However he took the opportunity and surprised his girlfriend so much she wasn't even able to respond straight away. Bass, 28, told Woman's Day she was so overwhelmed that she just 'kept laughing and crying' and had to calm herself down before she could respond. Her now-fiance presented her with a two-carat solitaire set among 14 pale pink diamonds the colour of cherry blossoms, a reminder of where the special moment took place.

The sprint king previously dated fellow swimmer Stephanie Rice for two years before the couple split prior to the Beijing Olympics in 2008. At the time it was suggested that the pair's relationship ended to ease the focus on the power couple ahead of the sporting event.

3250,"Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim was furious after his side lost 1-0 to what he described as a 'non-existent penalty' in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at Juventus on Tuesday. The controversial decision will add to calls for the use of video replays as it was still not fully clear what happened, even after several repeats of the incident in slow motion. The spot kick was awarded after Juve's Alvaro Morata got clear of Monaco's Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho as the striker chased a long ball forward from Andrea Pirlo. Ricardo's Carvalho's initial contact on Alvaro Morata appeared to come from outside the area . The Juventus striker went down under Carvalho's challenge and the referee pointed to the penalty spot . Monaco defender Carvalho and Spanish forward Morata crash to the ground in the penalty area . Replays showed that Carvalho nudged Morata just outside the area but the Spaniard's fall took him inside the box and it was not clear whether there was further contact. Czech referee Pavel Kralovec hesitated slightly, possibly consulting his goal line assistant, before pointing to the spot, while Carvalho was booked. 'It's a huge injustice, there was no penalty,' Jardim told reporters. 'We put Juventus in difficulties, but the result was based on a non-existent situation in an evenly-balanced match. 'The result was created by an incorrect decision by the team (of officials) that referees,' he added. 'This result is not a fair reflection of what happened on the field.' 'All teams should have the same duties and rights,' said the Portuguese coach, who has been widely praised for taking an apparently limited team so far. Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim claimed the penalty decision against his side was a 'huge injustice' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said Carvalho was 'the last man', but otherwise preferred not to get involved. 'I didn't see it, so I couldn't judge. It seems he was the last man,' said the phlegmatic coach. 'Whether it was inside or outside, I don't know.' There was a further surprise when midfielder Arturo Vidal, rather than forward Carlos Tevez, stepped up to take the kick. Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal steps up to score from the spot against Monaco during Tuesday's clash . Vidal celebrates what turned out to be the winning strike after scoring for Juventus against Monaco in Turin . Vidal has already missed two penalties this season, one in the 3-2 group stage win over Olympiakos Piraeus, and another in the 2-2 draw at Cesena in Serie A, when he could have scored a late winner. Tevez and Vidal had wasted good first-half chances in Tuesday's game but the Chilean said he was still confident. 'We don't have a first-choice penalty-taker, it's a case of whoever has more faith at that moment,' said Vidal. 'I felt I should take it and Carlitos agreed.'","Juventus were awarded penalty fouling foul on striker Alvaro Morata .

7413,"Beer is booming at discount supermarket chain Aldi which increased its share of the premium ale market by a third stealing customers away from troubled giant Tesco. Tesco does still have the biggest share of the lucrative market, which research by Kantar shows has grown by more than 10 per cent over the last year and is now worth £490million. The leader has improved its market share in the increasingly fashionable premium ale market, but it's believed Aldi is luring customers away from Tesco, offering a smaller range but cheaper prices. Another chapter: Fluctuations in the premium ale market are just a small part of the shopping revolution which has seen shoppers flock away from giants like Tesco and towards the growing discounters . To use an example of the difference in price, Aldi sells bottles of Newcastle brown ale for £1.24. They costs £1.64 at Tesco and Waitrose and £1.65 at Morrisons. The discounter has also increased wine sales by 24 per cent over the last years which shows drinkers with all tastes are now flocking to Aldi to buy their booze. It's another chapter in the rise of discounters who are slowly stealing market share from the big three, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda. Other research, also by Kantar, showed that Aldi overtook Waitrose as Britain's sixth biggest supermarket with its performance in the first three months of 2015, increasing share of the whole supermarket industry from 4.6 top 5.3 per cent in a year. The top four supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have all lost market share in the first three months of 2015. Aldi, Waitrose and Lidl managed to increase thiers, with Aldi showing the biggest rise . Tesco has had a troublesome year, with its year-on-year share price down 18 per cent. Last year, they discovered a £263million gap in their accounts which involved rebates to suppliers and is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. Shortly afterwards they sacked boss Phil Clarke who was replaced by Unilever executive Dave Lewis, who announced a series of money-saving measures to try and turn the tide.. The research into the premium ale market doesn't tell a very consistent story, with all but two of the big supermarkets managing to increase their market share. Sainsbury's currently has the second largest share in the beer market which it has improved by 7 per cent while Asda, third, increased by 1.5 per cent. Upmarket Waitrose, which also saw a double-digit increase in the premium ale market, now has a 5.1 per cent share of the entire supermaket industry. But while Aldi made great gains, Lidl, the other rising discounter to have improved its share in the supermarket industry, saw a 7.9 per cent fall in its proportion of the premium beer market. Morrisons’ share dipped 1.4 per cent . In January Tesco published the location of 43 loss-making stores that will close, and shelved plans to open a further 49 stores. City bosses expect them to announce huge losses in profit next week. It's been a totally different story for Aldi, which offers cheap prices and a smaller range that have helped them compete with the big boys. Aldi – motto Spend a little. Live a lot – stocks virtually all own-branded goods and and they're market share has grown by 0.7 per cent this year. It plans to open 60 new stores in 2015, more than than Sainsbury’s and Tesco put together. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. The total market share of the ‘big four’ fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl also saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share. This is some way off Tesco’s dominant 28.4 per cent share, followed by Asda at 17.1 per cent.","Fashionable premium ale market grew more than 10 per cent to £490million .

4507,"A cancer patient has told how a large tumour underneath her left breast 'dissolved away' after a pioneering new treatment. The 49-year-old woman showed a staggering response to a new combination of two drugs, to treat skin cancer. Doctors at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York have hailed their patient's recovery 'one of the most astonishing responses', ever seen. Scientists at the hospital have conducted a trial, treating patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma with a new type of treatment. They combined a standard drug already used, ipilimumab, with another, nivolumab. A 49-year-old cancer patient's giant tumour underneath her left breast (starred left) was 'completely destroyed' and 'dissolved away' (right) after she received a pioneering new drugs cocktail to treat melanoma . They hope the new therapy could save thousands of lives in future. A case report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reveals that after just one dose of the two drugs, the 49-year-old woman reported her tumour 'kind of dissolved'. Four years ago doctors removed a 4.2mm melanoma from her back. After treatment, and a year-and-a-half later, doctors discovered the cancer had returned. Then five months ago, another growth was removed from under the patient's left breast. But despite surgery, the disease returned. When the patient arrived at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she had developed a huge tumour underneath her left breast, which protruded through the skin. The woman was given her first dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab, without complaining of any side effects. When she returned to the hospital three weeks later, for her second dose of the drugs combination, she revealed to doctors the huge mass underneath her left breast had 'disappeared', leaving a hole in the skin. Doctors treating her said: 'This patient had a rapid eradication of a large tumour mass after a single treatment with combination immunotherapy.' She now, no longer has any detectable melanoma. 'This is one of the most astonishing responses I have seen,' said medical oncologist Paul Chapman. 'It reminds us of the potential power of the immune system if we can remove the ""brakes"" that keep it from attacking cancer cells.' The World Health Organisation estimates that worldwide there are 66,000 deaths annually from skin cancer, with approximately 80 per cent due to melanoma. Researchers at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, led by medical oncologist Michael Postow, examined 142 patients with advanced melanoma, as part of their trials. Patients were randomly assigned to receive ipilimumab and nivolumab or ipilimumab plus a placebo. Those selected to receive ipilimumab with a placebo to start with, were later allowed to receive nivolumab if the first drug was ineffective. In a staggering 61 per cent of patients receiving the combination therapy, the researchers found significant tumour shrinkage. That was compared to just 11 per cent of the patients receiving ipilimumab plus a placebo. Patients receiving both drugs also lived longer without their disease progressing. The patient was treated as part of a clinical trial to test the effects of a new drugs combination on patients with advanced melanoma, pictured. The study found 61 per cent of those treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab showed signs of their tumours shrinking . But the side effects experienced by the patients on the combination therapy were worse, though they were still manageable. Dr Postow said: 'The incredibly high response rate seen in this trial for patients receiving the combination - approximately 60 per cent - now lets us tell patients that they have a high chance of significantly shrinking their melanoma with this treatment. 'More research is still needed, however, to know if it is necessary to give all patients this combination, or if patients should receive drugs like nivolumab and ipilimumab in sequence.' Senior author, Jedd Wolchok, chief of the melanoma and immunotherapeutics service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), said: 'We are excited about these results and believe they support the principle that rationally combining effective medicines is an approach to achieving better outcomes for patients.' The US Food and Drug Administration approved nivolumab late last year. Doctors at MSK helped spearhead clinical trials testing the drug's safety and effectiveness and continue to conduct studies using the drug to treat melanoma and other cancers. The findings were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research Annual Meeting.","Doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York were trialling a new combination of drugs to treat advanced skin cancer .

4390,"A former Marine who was sentenced two years ago for starting a fire that caused over $1million in damages to an Ohio mosque has sent a letter apologizing and asking forgiveness from its members. Randy Linn, now in a California federal prison where he's two years into his 20-year sentence, said that he can't believe that he tried to destroy a place of worship. Federal prosecutors said Linn drove about two hours from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to suburban Toledo on September 30, 2012, and broke into the mosque where he poured gasoline on a prayer rug and lit it on fire. Randy Linn was sentenced two years ago for starting a fire that caused over $1million in damages to a suburban Toledo, Ohio, mosque . Federal prosecutors said Linn drove from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo (pictured) in September 20112, broke into the mosque, poured gasoline on a prayer rug and set it on fire . 'Well again, I’m very sorry for what I did. Hopefully someday you all can forgive me. And yes I don’t like it here, you can tell everyone, that I’m sure will put a smile on everyone face,' he said in his letter, according to The Blade. Cherrefe Kadri, president of the center, said she thought Linn's letter was sincere . Linn had several firearms in his car and carried a gun into the mosque, which was empty at the time. Linn later said while pleading guilty to hate crime charges that he'd become enraged after seeing images of wounded soldiers in the news and decided to burn the mosque. He also blamed what happened on a day of heavy drinking. Being forgiven, he wrote last December, would 'probably give me a little bit of peace of mind.' Cherrefe Kadri, president of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, told The Blade said she waited nearly six weeks to respond to Linn's letter. Most of the members have moved on, she said. 'I think his letter was truly sincere, and I told him that,' she said. Her response, written on stationery with an image of the mosque at the top, said that she hopes he can make peace with God. 'Neither our community nor I harbor any hatred, ill-will or malice toward you,' she wrote. A sprinkler system extinguished the blaze, leaving smoke and water damage in the prayer room of the facility. No one was injured in the fire.","Randy Linn was sentenced two years ago for starting a fire that caused $1million in damages to a suburban Toledo, Ohio mosque .

Instead of scrolling through holiday deals on bargain-finding websites, these ultra-wealthy individuals prefer to take off on a moment's notice and sort out any over-the-top accommodations and activities upon arrival. To get a glimpse inside this elite - and rarely planned - world, MailOnline Travel spoke to wedding and event planner Sarah Haywood, who has helped organise ceremonies and honeymoons for everyone from celebrities to Fortune 500 businessmen.

Haywood reveals that she often works with these agencies, where she estimates that membership fees for such a service start at about £50,000. 'These aren't companies you'll find online,' she adds. 'The people that they're working with don't plan and they expect things to be catered to their whims.'

Victoria Hoffman, who owns her on US-based concierge service, reveals she's had clients request special access to exclusive events such as the Cannes Film Festival . Specialist Italian travel company, Bellini Travel, set up by Emily FitzRoy 15 years ago, is so exclusive that it only caters to a carefully selected list of 100 clients a year. 'As we look after a limited number of people each year, we can pull in huge favours,' Emily said. 'For example, we're just in the middle of negotiating to close the Uffizi for a client who only has 24 hours in Florence, but wants to see Botticelli's Birth of Venus on his own. Brown and Hudson describe themselves as the antidote to everything that is packaged and unconsidered about today’s luxury travel business. Their bespoke service, which charges a minimum of £1,000 simply to create an itinerary for potential clients, has an impressive portfolio of bespoke experiences they have orchestrated for guests. Alexander Martin, director of luxury lifestyle website The Envy Group agrees that for the super-rich, it's not about what you give, so much as the amazing experience behind it. 'Our clients - or 'friends' as we call them - are very successful and generous people, and we help them create unique lifestyle experiences that goes far beyond booking a table at an amazing restaurant. 'We recently organised the world's only Tiffany-blue Bentley for one of our friends, and created a 20ft Tiffany-inspired remote-controlled hydraulic gift box complete to deliver it in.' And if you're heading to the luxurious five-star properties hoping to catch a glimpse of some of the world's wealthiest individuals, don't bother. Haywood tells us the the ultra-elite don't often check in to big hotels, much preferring somewhere private for their opulent getaways. 'This is above just a private island in the Maldives,' she tells us. 'People with this kind of money aren't looking at what's fashionable, they're looking for privacy and security. 'The world's wealthiest like to stay low profile, so we'll be looking at places where they can do that.' Hoffman agrees, explaining that more and more clients have been asking her recently to rent villas and help them to live like a local. Instead of splashing out on a luxurious suite, the ultra-rich prefer to rent their own private Maldivian island . Haywood cites Cote d'Azur and the Maldives as two locations favoured by her A-list clientele, while Hoffman notes that she has planned extravagant vacation experiences everywhere from Paris to Italy. 'We once provided access to Coco Chanel's apartment and private jewellery collection,' Hoffman tells MailOnline Travel. 'The entire experience was a day in the life of Coco in which the clients dined and had afternoon tea in many of the places in Paris she frequented. 'In other scenarios, we have given privileged access to the private estates of winemakers in Bordeaux, Burgundy and Piedmont. 'In one case, my client wanted to relive the 18th century, so we had period costumes and horse-drawn carriages for the day.

8171,"The Fulham fans in the Jimmy Steed Stand applauded their team at the final whistle. It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point . The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley . He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos. Not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages, feeding striker Smith well. Ross McCormack headed over a stranded Stephen Henderson with just eight minutes played in London . McCormack celebrates his goal in front of the traveling Fulham fans with just eight minutes played . Charlton Athletic: Henderson, Gomez, Ben Haim, Johnson, Fox, Johann Gudmundsson, Cousins, Diarra, Bulot (Eagles 70) Vetokele (Church 79) Watt . Subs: Bikey Amougou, Wiggins, Lennon, Dmitrovic, Lepoint . Fulham: Bettinelli, Hoogland, Burn, Turner, Husband, Parker, Tunnicliffe, Guthrie,(Kacaniklic 68), Kavanagh (Ruiz 68), Smith, McCormack . Subs: Kiraly, Stafylidis, Woodrow, Rodallega, Donnelly . But Charlton hit back with a 16th minute equaliser. Morgan Fox’s cross bounced across the front of goal and Frederic Bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect. It was left for a waiting Johann Gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner. Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who seemed rooted to the spot, wisely dragged a furious James Husband, who seemed to believe the goal offside, from a confrontation with the linesman. Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute. Matt Smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint James Husband cross but Henderson did well to thwart the effort. Charlton soon asserted control with Tony Watt going close three times before Parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge. The Charlton players were outraged when referee Andy Madley awarded Fulham a free kick 25 yards out deep into stoppage time but McCormack blasted the ball over the bar. Joseph Gomez  and Dan Burn fight for the ball during match between Charlton Athletic and Fulham . Fulham now sit 20th in the table eight points clear of fellow London rivals Millwall, but Symons is refusing to relax just yet.

145,"Johannesburg (CNN)South African troops deployed Tuesday evening as part of a new government effort to stop deadly anti-immigrant violence. Their first target: the Johannesburg suburb of Jeppestown, where xenophobic violence broke out on Friday. South African police raided a Jeppestown hostel Tuesday while troops secured the perimeter. Earlier, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula announced the plan to deploy an undisclosed number of troops to areas where police are spread too thin while trying to curb deadly attacks against immigrants. ""This intervention is not an indictment on the police. ... We are coming in because they need that support,"" she said after visiting Johannesburg's Alexandra township, one area where mobs have attacked immigrants from other African nations and looted their shops -- ostensibly based on the belief that immigrants are taking South Africans' jobs. Seven people have been killed in recent violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa's neighbors. Xenophobic killing caught by photographer . Much of this month's violence happened in the port city of Durban, where at least two foreigners and three South Africans were killed after mobs with machetes attacked immigrant shops. Thousands of people took temporary shelter at refugee centers or police stations as a result, according to aid group Gift of the Givers. Similar violence happened late last week in Johannesburg, where immigrant-owned shops were looted or destroyed. The attacks came as residents accused immigrants of taking their jobs and committing crimes. The unemployment rate in South Africa is 25%, according to government figures. The United Nations said the attacks began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. What's behind the xenophobic attacks in South Africa?

5292,"At first glance, the rest of our solar system seems to be a pretty barren place - pockmarked worlds with dry surfaces are abundant, and only one - Earth - has visible water. But by peering beneath the surfaces of other worlds, scientists are quickly realising that water may actually be much more commonplace than thought. Nine other worlds in total are now suspected to have some form of subsurface ocean containing far more water than is on Earth - and some may even contain life, according to Nasa. Nasa has released an infographic explaining which worlds in the solar system are thought to have oceans under their surface, such as Ceres, seen here. The distance from the sun is given in AU, which stands for Astronomical Unit - and one AU is the distance from Earth to the sun . The agency released an infographic detailing the various worlds of our solar system suspected to have subsurface oceans. It followed claims by Dr Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for the agency, that we could find life in the next ten or 20 years. ‘Nasa science activities have provided a wave of amazing findings related to water in recent years that inspire us to continue investigating our origins and the fascinating possibilities for other worlds, and life, in the universe,’ she said. ‘In our lifetime, we may very well finally answer whether we are alone in the solar system and beyond.’ There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy - and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington this week, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Dr Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Dr Jeffrey Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Dr Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' Water is important because life, as we know it, needs it to survive. Some may say that there could be other forms of life that don’t need water - but as we don’t know of any yet, it makes sense to look for wet environments to discover if we are alone or not. ‘As Nasa missions explore our solar system and search for new worlds, they are finding water in surprising places,’ the agency said in a statement. ‘Water is but one piece of our search for habitable planets and life beyond Earth, yet it links many seemingly unrelated worlds in surprising ways.’ The chemical elements in water, hydrogen and oxygen, are some of the most abundant elements in the universe. The signature of water can be seen in the giant molecular clouds between stars, or in disks of material in young planetary systems. In our solar system the gas giant planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - are thought to contains lots of water in their atmospheres. But it is the solid moons and dwarf planets that are of more interest. For example, scientists using Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice. Signs of an underground ocean on Europa can be seen in the lines that are strewn across its surface. A nasa mission next decade will seek to search for water emanating from Europa - and see if its oceans are habitable. Ganymede, meanwhile, has layers of water and ice below its surface . Scientists using Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice. The water forms because the moon is pushed and pulled by the gas giant Jupiter . Here the lines across Europa's surface can be seen, likely caused by the icy surface cracking due to the motion of water underground . On its surface, Callisto is a barren world covered in craters, but underground it might also have an underground ocean. Meanwhile, geysers of water have been seen shooting from Enceladus . Water on worlds like Ganymede forms through tidal heating; its orbit around Jupiter is not perfectly circular, so it is pushed and pulled by the planet’s gravity, melting ice beneath its surface. Saturn’s moons Europa and Enceladus are also thought to have an ocean of liquid water beneath their surface, in contact with mineral-rich rock, and may have the three ingredients needed for life as we know it. These are liquid water, essential chemical elements for biological processes and sources of energy that could be used by living things. Nasa's Cassini mission has also revealed Enceladus as an active world of icy geysers. Recent research suggests it may have hydrothermal activity on its ocean floor, an environment potentially suitable for living organisms. Signs of water have also been spotted in craters on Mercury, while it appears that Mars was at least once wet - and may still have occasional brief rivers of water on its surface. The dwarf planet Ceres, between Earth and Jupiter, may also have some water-ice on its surface - and water underground. Nasa’s Dawn spacecraft, which recently arrived in orbit, will hopefully reveal how wet this world is. Titan could have lakes of liquid hydrocarbons on its surface, but may also have an ocean of water underground - although its unlikely to support life. Mimas, meanwhile, often compared to the Death Star from Star Wars owing to its huge crater, could possibly harbor life . Jets of material are seen shooting from Enceladus here, as pictured by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft. Exactly how these jets form or what they are made of, however, is not clear . Nasa recently announced that it is now thought Mars once had more water than the Arctic Ocean on Earth, shown in this illustration. Almost of this water has gone today, leaving the world barren and dry . Towards the outer reaches of the solar system, even Neptune's moon Triton and the dwarf planet Pluto may have some sort of ocean hiding under their surfaces . Other moons including Callisto, Titan, Mimas and Triton are also thought to have underground oceans, while Pluto at the edge of the solar system may, too, be equally wet. And if these worlds are proven to have water, it stands to reason that others outside the solar system may also have oceans, either underground or on their surface. Missions like the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess) - scheduled to launch in 2017 - will such nearby, bright stars for Earth-sized worlds, some of which may have water. And Nasa’s next great space observatory meanwhile, the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2019, will examine the atmospheres of certain worlds in detail. ‘It's easy to forget that the story of Earth's water, from gentle rains to raging rivers, is intimately connected to the larger story of our solar system and beyond,’ Nasa said in a statement. ‘But our water came from somewhere - every world in our solar system got its water from the same shared source. ‘So it's worth considering that the next glass of water you drink could easily have been part of a comet, or an ocean moon, or a long-vanished sea on the surface of Mars. ‘And note that the night sky may be full of exoplanets formed by similar processes to our home world, where gentle waves wash against the shores of alien seas.’","Nasa scientists in California say our solar system is full of water .

10762,"Lauren Crawley was given a new platinum implant . Facial palsy, or weakness of the facial muscles, can stop the patient's eyelids closing properly. Lauren Crawley, 54, a housewife from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again, as she tells THEA JOURDAN. THE PATIENT . A few years ago I started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my GP referred me for scans which showed I had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear. Surgery was the only option. Thankfully the operation, in July 2012, was a success. But my facial nerve, which was wrapped around the tumour, was damaged. I'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side-effect, but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy. Apparently, it's the same thing that can happen after a stroke. I felt very self-conscious, but the problems weren't just aesthetic. I'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste, and my mouth became dry. Eating and speaking were difficult - and, worst of all, my left eye was permanently open and I couldn't even blink with it. To close it, I had to push the upper lid down with my hand. The eye itself was dry and painful. To sleep, I had to seal it closed with tape. I'd been told that about half those with the condition do improve, so I was hopeful. I tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone, including facial massages, taught by a physiotherapist. I also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscles back to life. But nothing worked. It was very stressful - I stopped socialising as much, in case people stared. After a year, it was clear the nerve would never work again so I was referred to Raman Malhotra, a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the Queen Victoria Hospital. He explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - I'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this wasn't affected. Apparently, surgeons used to use gold, but platinum is better because it doesn't irritate the eye's inside lining. It is also more dense than gold, so you need only a thin chain, which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid. I had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in February last year. Surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it . My eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye, then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place. It was strange watching it all but didn't hurt. I went home that day, and the difference was immediately obvious. The eye gently shut, and stayed shut, of its own accord. I could go to sleep without needing tape. I can't feel the implant, no one can see it, and I can blink normally. The procedure has made me look more normal - people don't stare as much. It's really boosted my confidence. THE SURGEON . Raman Malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Around 100,000 people in Britain have facial palsy. It can be caused by a stroke, if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve. It can also be a result of traumatic injury, damage after surgery, or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in Bell's palsy, which affects more than 28,000 people a year. Facial palsy affects not just appearance, but lots of functions, too. The facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides, then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue's taste buds, for instance, and the salivary glands, so patients may suffer from dry mouth. Most also have difficulty blinking, because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut. However, it does not control the levator muscle, which holds it open. While many patients will recover, with symptoms easing within eight weeks, Lauren's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function. When she first saw me, her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways. This can cause all sorts of problems, from dryness to injury. Five years ago, I would have recommended a gold implant - in the shape of a very thin bar - fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid. The extra weight makes the eyelid heavier, so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes. This procedure is used widely across the NHS. But I now believe platinum is much better. It's 10 per cent more dense than gold, so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight. Platinum is also inert - gold will cause reactions, such as irritation and inflammation, in about 5 per cent of people. The left side of her face was droopy - until now . I helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight. For Lauren, I used three links weighing 0.4g each. This is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light. This way, we can easily add or remove a link. In 2013, we carried out a study at Queen Victoria Hospital, using platinum chain implants on 18 patients. Only two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant, compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant (the study will be published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology). First, we anaesthetised the skin around Lauren's eye. Then, on a workbench, I linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight I required (I'd previously done a trial run, sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight). I made an incision across the outside of her eyelid, where it makes a natural crease, making sure not to cut through to the eyeball. I placed the links inside this incision, above the eyeball, stitching the chain in place from the outside in, before closing the incision. These nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body. By then, the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue. When the chain was in place, and the eye was open, it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye. Even when the eye is shut, the implant doesn't touch the cornea. When Lauren wanted to blink, her brain switched off the levator muscle, which keeps the eyelid wide open. The corresponding muscle, the orbicularis occuli muscle, which should pull the eyelid down, does not work in Lauren's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve. The percentage of stroke patients who are affected by facial weakness . However, the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall, thanks to gravity. Although it wasn't a perfect solution - at first, Lauren's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again. Over time, the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves. Risks include infection and bleeding, but these are rare. I hope the implant will last Lauren a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'Gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy,' says Saj Ataullah, a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. 'Platinum is more expensive, but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions. And as the implants are less bulky, it's also superior cosmetically. 'This chain segment innovation seems to work well. Any procedure can result in post-operative problems, but these appear to be rare. 'Longer-term follow-up is needed before we can conclude that chain-link implants are truly superior to other platinum weights, such as bars. But they are promising so far.' The operation costs around £3,000 privately. The NHS does not automatically fund it .","Lauren Crawley had surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear .

8788,"(CNN)Danny Kahneman, my good friend and co-author who got a Nobel Prize in economics, once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies.  One group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure; the other group, which experienced the same type of colonoscopy, did not. It turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning. The psychology of it is simple to understand: Happy endings matter. Even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well. So too with taxes. Let's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average American, ""stuff"" happens (keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running), paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck.  But recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 American taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes, and the average amount is close to $3000. That pays for a lot of stuff. To make the good news even better, tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people, with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free. No filing headaches and a check to boot. What's not to like? The fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the U.S. tax system. For example, the laws are biased against two-worker marriages; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry, as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers. Taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich, who make their wealth off of their existing wealth, the largely untaxed returns from capital, rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us. But now is not the time to explain such serious matters; the people are too busy spending their refunds. The once dreaded Tax Day has become a happy spending spree for most Americans. This state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws. In brief, the U.S. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital (what the rich have) and limited deductions for most of us.  For example, 3 out of 4 Americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions. All of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians, professors and pundits. But who has time for that? Let's go to our television sets and check out the commercials. One clever spot ran during the recent Super Bowl, suggesting that the Boston Tea Party -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing, which the sponsor was eager to provide. Filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who doesn't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in April, the cruelest month? Now as Tax Day approaches, we are flooded with advertisements about America getting its billions back, without even having to pay to prepare the forms. We get paid to play! Here is the happy ending that Kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past. The simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer. Service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled Americans. Of course, these kind souls want their happy endings too. They are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers, the grateful taxpayers-turned-consumers will happily purchase add-on services, such as ""audit protection insurance,"" or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider. Just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees, the ""found money"" of tax returns can finance many nice purchases. Of course, there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws, biased against modern families and wage earners, and in favor of the rich living off capital.  No real bother -- stuff happens. Let others fret about fairness. As long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before?","Edward McCaffery: There's a fundamental unfairness to U.S. tax laws .
But Americans don't care because most of us get a refund on Tax Day, and that makes us happy ."
8467,"The Liberal Democrats have admitted they are on course to lose at least 20 MPs, but claim this could still be enough to put them back in power. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed. But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Eastleigh in Hampshire . Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support,  to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge. Mr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling. The Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country. 'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.' He added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media. 'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.' Mr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. The alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'. In a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat. 'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.' He added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.' Asked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.' A new survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent . The Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe. The latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call. David Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Another poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour. However, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories' 33 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders. Labour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one). North of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.","Party on course to lose a third of the 57 seats it won in 2010, sources say .
